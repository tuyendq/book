ON WAKING UPsNEWLINEs
01sNEWLINEs

Spirituality means wal&lt;ing up. IMost people, even though they don'tsNEWLINEs
know it, are asleep. They're born asleep, they live asleep, they marrysNEWLINEs
in their sleep, they breed children in their sleep, they die in theirsNEWLINEs
sleep without ever waking up. They never understand the lovelinesssNEWLINEs
and the beauty of this thing that we call human existence. You know,sNEWLINEs
all mystics - Catholic, Christian, non-Christian, no matter what theirsNEWLINEs
theology, no matter what their religion - are unanimous on one thing:sNEWLINEs
that all is well, all is well. Though everything is a mess, all is well.sNEWLINEs
Strange paradox, to be sure. But, tragically, most people never get tosNEWLINEs
see that all is well because they are asleep. They are having asNEWLINEs
nightmare.sNEWLINEs

Last year on Spanish television I heard a story about this gentlemansNEWLINEs
who knocks on his son's door. "Jaime", he says, "wake up"! JaimesNEWLINEs
answers, "I don't want to get up. Papa". The father shouts, "Get up,sNEWLINEs
you have to go to school". J aime says, "I don't want to go to school".sNEWLINEs
"Why not"? asks the father. "Three reasons", says Jaime. "First,sNEWLINEs
because it's so dull; second, the kids tease me; and third, I hatesNEWLINEs
school". And the father says, "Well, I am going to give you threesNEWLINEs
reasons why you must go to school. First, because it is your duty;sNEWLINEs
second, because you are forty-five years old, and third, because yousNEWLINEs
are the headmaster". Wake up, wake up! You've grown up. You're toosNEWLINEs
big to be asleep. Wake up! Stop playing with your toys.sNEWLINEs





Most people tell you they want to get out of kindergarten, but don'tsNEWLINEs
believe them. Don't believe them! All they want you to do is to mendsNEWLINEs
their broken toys. "Give me back my wife. Give me back my job. GivesNEWLINEs
me back my money. Give me back my reputation, my success". ThissNEWLINEs
is what they want; they want their toys replaced. That's all. Even thesNEWLINEs
best psychologist will tell you that, that people don't really want to besNEWLINEs
cured. What they want is relief; a cure is painful.sNEWLINEs

Waking up is unpleasant, you know. You are nice and comfortable insNEWLINEs
bed. It's irritating to be woken up. That's the reason the wise gurusNEWLINEs
will not attempt to wake people up. I hope I 'm going to be wise heresNEWLINEs
and make no attempt whatsoever to wake you up if you are asleep. ItsNEWLINEs
is really none of my business, even though I say to you at times,sNEWLINEs
"Wake up!" My business is to do my thing, to dance my dance. If yousNEWLINEs
profit from it, fine; if you don't, too bad! As the Arabs say, "ThesNEWLINEs
nature of rain is the same, but it makes thorns grow in the marshessNEWLINEs
and flowers in the gardens".sNEWLINEs



WILL I BE OF HELP TO YOU?sNEWLINEs
02sNEWLINEs

Do you think I am going to help anybody? No! Oh, no, no, no, no, no!sNEWLINEs
Don't expect me to be of help to anyone. Nor do I expect to damagesNEWLINEs
anyone. If you are damaged, you did it; and if you are helped, yousNEWLINEs
did it. You really did! You think people help you? They don't. YousNEWLINEs
think people support you? They don't.sNEWLINEs

There was a woman in a therapy group I was conducting once. ShesNEWLINEs
was a religious sister. She said to me, "I don't feel supported by mysNEWLINEs
superior". So I said, "What do you mean by that"? And she said,sNEWLINEs
"Well, my superior, the provincial superior, never shows up at thesNEWLINEs
novitiate where I am in charge, never. She never says a word ofsNEWLINEs
appreciation". I said to her, "All right let's do a little role playing.sNEWLINEs
Pretend I know your provincial superior. In fact, pretend I knowsNEWLINEs
exactly what she thinks about you.sNEWLINEs

So I say to you (acting the part of the provincial superior), 'YousNEWLINEs
know, Mary, the reason I don't come to that place you're in issNEWLINEs
because it is the one place in the province that is trouble-free, nosNEWLINEs
problems. I know you're in charge, so all is well.' How do you feelsNEWLINEs





now"? She said, "I feel great". Then I said to her, "All right, wouldsNEWLINEs
you mind leaving the room for a minute or two? This is part of thesNEWLINEs
exercise". So she did. While she was away, I said to the others in thesNEWLINEs
therapy group, "I am still the provincial superior, O.K.?sNEWLINEs

Mary out there is the worst novice director I have ever had in thesNEWLINEs
whole history of the province. I n fact, the reason I don't go to thesNEWLINEs
novitiate is because I can't bear to see what she is up to. It's simplysNEWLINEs
awful. But if I tell her the truth, it's only going to make those novicessNEWLINEs
suffer all the more. We are getting somebody to take her place in asNEWLINEs
year or two; we are training someone. I n the meantime I thought IsNEWLINEs
would say those nice things to her to keep her going. What do yousNEWLINEs
think of that"?sNEWLINEs

They answered, "Well, it was really the only thing you could do undersNEWLINEs
the circumstances". Then I brought Mary back into the group andsNEWLINEs
asked her if she still felt great. "Oh yes", she said. Poor Mary! ShesNEWLINEs
thought she was being supported when she wasn't. The point is thatsNEWLINEs
most of what we feel and think we conjure up for ourselves in oursNEWLINEs
heads, including this business of being helped by people.sNEWLINEs

Do you think you help people because you are in love with them?sNEWLINEs
Well, I 've got news for you. You are never in love with anyone. You'resNEWLINEs
only in love with your prejudiced and hopeful idea of that person.sNEWLINEs
Take a minute to think about that: You are never in love with anyone,sNEWLINEs
you're in love with your prejudiced idea of that person. Isn't that howsNEWLINEs
you fall out of love? Your idea changes, doesn't it? "How could you letsNEWLINEs
me down when I trusted you so much"? you say to someone. Did yousNEWLINEs
really trust them? You never trusted anyone. Come off it!sNEWLINEs

That's part of society's brainwashing. You never trust anyone. YousNEWLINEs
only trust your judgment about that person. So what are yousNEWLINEs
complaining about? The fact is that you don't like to say, "MysNEWLINEs
judgment was lousy". That's not very flattering to you, is it? So yousNEWLINEs
prefer to say, "How could you have let me down"? So there it is:sNEWLINEs
People don't really want to grow up, people don't really want tosNEWLINEs
change, people don't really want to be happy. As someone so wiselysNEWLINEs
said to me, "Don't try to make them happy, you'll only get in trouble.sNEWLINEs
Don't try to teach a pig to sing; it wastes your time and it irritates thesNEWLINEs
pig".sNEWLINEs

Like the businessman who goes into a bar, sits down, and sees thissNEWLINEs
fellow with a banana in his ear - a banana in his ear! And he thinks,sNEWLINEs
"I wonder if I should mention that to him. No, it's none of mysNEWLINEs





business". But the thought nags at him. So after having a drinl&lt; orsNEWLINEs
two, he says to the fellow, "Excuse me, ah, you've got a banana insNEWLINEs
your ear". The fellow says, "What"? The businessman repeats,sNEWLINEs
"You've got a banana in your ear. "Again the fellow says, "What wassNEWLINEs
that"? "You've got a banana in your ear!" the businessman shouts.sNEWLINEs
"Talk louder", the fellow says, "I've got a banana in my ear!" So it'ssNEWLINEs
useless. "Give up, give up, give up", I say to myself. Say your thingsNEWLINEs
and get out of here. And if they profit, that's fine, and if they don't,sNEWLINEs
too bad!sNEWLINEs



ON THE PROPER KIND OF SELFISHNESSsNEWLINEs

03sNEWLINEs

The first thing I want you to understand, if you really want to wakesNEWLINEs
up, is that you don't want to wake up. The first step to waking up issNEWLINEs
to be honest enough to admit to yourself that you don't like it. YousNEWLINEs
don't want to be happy. Want a little test? Let's try it. It will take yousNEWLINEs
exactly one minute. You could close your eyes while you're doing it orsNEWLINEs
you could keep them open. It doesn't really matter.sNEWLINEs

Think of someone you love very much, someone you're close to,sNEWLINEs
someone who is precious to you, and say to that person in your mind,sNEWLINEs
"I'd rather have happiness than have you". See what happens. "I'dsNEWLINEs
rather be happy than have you. If I had a choice, no question aboutsNEWLINEs
it, I'd choose happiness". How many of you felt selfish when you saidsNEWLINEs
this? Many, it seems. See how we've been brainwashed? See howsNEWLINEs
we've been brainwashed into thinking, "How could I be so selfish"?sNEWLINEs
But look at who's being selfish. Imagine somebody saying to YOU,sNEWLINEs
"How could you be so selfish that you'd choose happiness over me"?sNEWLINEs
Would you not feel like responding, "Pardon me, but how could YOUsNEWLINEs
be so selfish that YOU would demand I choose you above my ownsNEWLINEs
happiness?!"sNEWLINEs

A woman once told me that when she was a child her Jesuit cousinsNEWLINEs
gave a retreat in the Jesuit church in Milwaukee. He opened eachsNEWLINEs
conference with the words: "The test of love is sacrifice, and thesNEWLINEs
gauge of love is unselfishness". That's marvelous! I asked her,sNEWLINEs
"Would you want me to love you at the cost of my happiness"? "Yes",sNEWLINEs
she answered. Isn't that delightful? Wouldn't that be wonderful? SHEsNEWLINEs
would love me at the cost of HER happiness and I would love her atsNEWLINEs







the cost of MY happiness, and so you've got two unhappy people, butsNEWLINEs
LONG LIVE LOVE!sNEWLINEs



ON WANTING HAPPINESSsNEWLINEs
04sNEWLINEs

I was saying that we don't want to be happy. We want other things.sNEWLINEs
Or let's put it more accurately: We don't want to be unconditionallysNEWLINEs
happy. I'm ready to be happy provided I have this and that and thesNEWLINEs
other thing. But this is really to say to our friend or to our God or tosNEWLINEs
anyone, "You are my happiness. If I don't get you, I refuse to besNEWLINEs
happy". It's so important to understand that. We cannot imaginesNEWLINEs
being happy without those conditions. That's pretty accurate. WesNEWLINEs
cannot conceive of being happy without them. We've been taught tosNEWLINEs
place our happiness in them.sNEWLINEs

So that's the first thing we need to do if we want to come awake,sNEWLINEs
which is the same thing as saying: if we want to love, if we wantsNEWLINEs
freedom, if we want joy and peace and spirituality. I n that sense,sNEWLINEs
spirituality is the most practical thing in the whole wide world. IsNEWLINEs
challenge anyone to think of anything more practical than spiritualitysNEWLINEs
as I have defined it — not piety, not devotion, not religion, notsNEWLINEs
worship, but spirituality — waking up, waking up! Look at thesNEWLINEs
heartache everywhere, look at the loneliness, look at the fear, thesNEWLINEs
confusion, the conflict in the hearts of people, inner conflict, outersNEWLINEs
conflict.sNEWLINEs

Suppose somebody gave you a way of getting rid of all of that?sNEWLINEs
Suppose somebody gave you a way to stop that tremendous drainagesNEWLINEs
of energy, of health, of emotion that comes from these conflicts andsNEWLINEs
confusion. Would you want that? Suppose somebody showed us asNEWLINEs
way whereby we would truly love one another, and be at peace, be atsNEWLINEs
love. Can you think of anything more practical than that? But,sNEWLINEs
instead, you have people thinking that big business is more practical,sNEWLINEs
that politics is more practical, that science is more practical. What'ssNEWLINEs
the earthly use of putting a man on the moon when we cannot live onsNEWLINEs
the earth?sNEWLINEs







ARE WE TALKING ABOUT PSYCHOLOGYsNEWLINEs
IN THIS SPIRITUALITY COURSE?sNEWLINEs

05sNEWLINEs

Is psychology more practical than spirituality? Nothing is moresNEWLINEs
practical than spirituality. What can the poor psychologist do? He cansNEWLINEs
only relieve the pressure. I'm a psychologist myself, and I practicesNEWLINEs
psychotherapy, and I have this great conflict within me when I havesNEWLINEs
to choose sometimes between psychology and spirituality. I wonder ifsNEWLINEs
that makes sense to anybody here. It didn't make sense to me forsNEWLINEs
many years.sNEWLINEs

I'll explain. It didn't make sense to me for many years until IsNEWLINEs
suddenly discovered that people have to suffer enough in asNEWLINEs
relationship so that they get disillusioned with all relationships. Isn'tsNEWLINEs
that a terrible thing to think? They've got to suffer enough in asNEWLINEs
relationship before they wake up and say, "I'm sick of it! There mustsNEWLINEs
be a better way of living than depending on another human being".sNEWLINEs
And what was I doing as a psychotherapist? People were coming tosNEWLINEs
me with their relationship problems, with their communicationsNEWLINEs
problems, etc., and sometimes what I did was a help.sNEWLINEs

But sometimes, I'm sorry to say, it wasn't, because it kept peoplesNEWLINEs
asleep. Maybe they should have suffered a little more. Maybe theysNEWLINEs
ought to touch rock bottom and say, "I'm sick of it all. " It's onlysNEWLINEs
when you're sick of your sickness that you'll get out of it. Most peoplesNEWLINEs
go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist to get relief. I repeat: to getsNEWLINEs
relief. Not to get out of it.sNEWLINEs

There's the story of little Johnny who, they say, was mentallysNEWLINEs
retarded. But evidently he wasn't, as you'll learn from this story.sNEWLINEs
Johnny goes to modeling class in his school for special children andsNEWLINEs
he gets his piece of putty and he's modeling it. He takes a little lumpsNEWLINEs
of putty and goes to a corner of the room and he's playing with it.sNEWLINEs
The teacher comes up to him and says, "Hi, J ohnny". And J ohnnysNEWLINEs
says, "Hi". And the teacher says, "What's that you've got in yoursNEWLINEs
hand"? And J ohnny says, "This is a lump of cow dung". The teachersNEWLINEs
asks, "What are you making out of it"? He says, "I'm making asNEWLINEs
teacher".sNEWLINEs

The teacher thought, "Little J ohnny has regressed". So she calls outsNEWLINEs
to the principal, who was passing by the door at that moment, andsNEWLINEs
says, "Johnny has regressed".sNEWLINEs





So the principal goes up to J oiinny and says, "Hi, son". And J ohnnysNEWLINEs
says, "Hi". And the principal says, "What do you have in your hand"?sNEWLINEs
And he says, "A lump of cow dung". "What are you making out of it"?sNEWLINEs
And he says, "A principal".sNEWLINEs

The principal thinks that this is a case for the school psychologist.sNEWLINEs
"Send for the psychologist!"sNEWLINEs

The psychologist is a clever guy. He goes up and says, "Hi". AndsNEWLINEs
Johnny says, "Hi". And the psychologist says, "I know what you'vesNEWLINEs
got in your hand". "What"? "A lump cow dung". Johnny says, "Right".sNEWLINEs
"And I know what you're making out of it". "What"? "You're making asNEWLINEs
psychologist".sNEWLINEs

"Wrong. Not enough cow dung!"sNEWLINEs

And they called him mentally retarded! The poor psychologists,sNEWLINEs
they're doing a good job. They really are. There are times whensNEWLINEs
psychotherapy is a tremendous help, because when you're on thesNEWLINEs
verge of going insane, raving mad, you're about to become either asNEWLINEs
psychotic or a mystic. That's what the mystic is, the opposite of thesNEWLINEs
lunatic. Do you know one sign that you've woken up? It's when yousNEWLINEs
are asking yourself, "Am I crazy, or are all of them crazy"? It reallysNEWLINEs
is.sNEWLINEs

Because we are crazy. The whole world is crazy. Certifiable lunatics!sNEWLINEs
The only reason we're not locked up in an institution is that there aresNEWLINEs
so many of us. So we're crazy. We're living on crazy ideas about love,sNEWLINEs
about relationships, about happiness, about joy, about everything.sNEWLINEs
We're crazy to the point, I've come to believe, that if everybodysNEWLINEs
agrees on something, you can be sure it's wrong! Every new idea,sNEWLINEs
every great idea, when it first began was in a minority of one.sNEWLINEs

That man called J esus Christ - minority of one. Everybody was sayingsNEWLINEs
something different from what he was saying. The Buddha - minoritysNEWLINEs
of one. Everybody was saying something different from what he wassNEWLINEs
saying. I think it was Bertrand Russell who said, "Every great ideasNEWLINEs
starts out as a blasphemy". That's well and accurately put. You'resNEWLINEs
going to hear lots of blasphemies during these days. "He hathsNEWLINEs
blasphemed!" Because people are crazy, they're lunatics, and thesNEWLINEs
sooner you see this, the better for your mental and spiritual health.sNEWLINEs

Don't trust them. Don't trust your best friends. Get disillusioned withsNEWLINEs







your best friends. They're very clever. As you are in your dealingssNEWLINEs
with everybody else, though you probably don't know it. Ah, you'resNEWLINEs
so wily, and subtle, and clever. You're putting on a great act.sNEWLINEs

I'm not being very complimentary here, am I? But I repeat: You wantsNEWLINEs
to wake up. You're putting on a great act. And you don't even knowsNEWLINEs
it. You think you're being so loving. Ha! Whom are you loving? EvensNEWLINEs
your self-sacrifice gives you a good feeling, doesn't it? "I'm sacrificingsNEWLINEs
myself! I'm living up to my ideal". But you're getting something outsNEWLINEs
of it, aren't you? You're always getting something out of everythingsNEWLINEs
you do, until you wake up.sNEWLINEs

So there it is: step one. Realize that you don't want to wake up. It'ssNEWLINEs
pretty difficult to wake up when you have been hypnotized intosNEWLINEs
thinking that a scrap of old newspaper is a check for a million dollars.sNEWLINEs
How difficult it is to tear yourself away from that scrap of oldsNEWLINEs
newspaper.sNEWLINEs



NEITHER IS RENUNCIATION THE SOLUTIONsNEWLINEs

06sNEWLINEs

Anytime you're practicing renunciation, you're deluded. How aboutsNEWLINEs
that! You're deluded. What are you renouncing? Anytime yousNEWLINEs
renounce something, you are tied forever to the thing you renounce.sNEWLINEs
There's a guru in India who says, "Every time a prostitute comes tosNEWLINEs
me, she's talking about nothing but God. She says I 'm sick of this lifesNEWLINEs
that I 'm living. I want God. But every time a priest comes to me he'ssNEWLINEs
talking about nothing but sex". Very well, when you renouncesNEWLINEs
something, you're stuck to it forever. When you fight something,sNEWLINEs
you're tied to it forever. As long as you're fighting it, you are giving itsNEWLINEs
power. You give it as much power as you are using to fight it.sNEWLINEs

This includes communism and everything else. So you must "receive"sNEWLINEs
your demons, because when you fight them, you empower them. HassNEWLINEs
nobody ever told you this? When you renounce something, you'resNEWLINEs
tied to it. The only way to get out of this is to see through it. Don'tsNEWLINEs
renounce it, SEE THROUGH IT. Understand its true value and yousNEWLINEs
won't need to renounce it; it will just drop from your hands. But ofsNEWLINEs
course, if you don't see that, if you're hypnotized into thinking thatsNEWLINEs
you won't be happy without this, that, or the other thing, you'resNEWLINEs
stuck. What we need to do for you is not what so-called spiritualitysNEWLINEs





attempts to do --namely, to get you to make sacrifices, to renouncesNEWLINEs
tilings. Tliat's useiess. You're stiii asieep. Wliat we need to do is tosNEWLINEs
heip you understand, understand, understand, if you understood,sNEWLINEs
you'd simpiy drop tine desire for it. Tliis is anotlier way of saying: IfsNEWLINEs
you wol&lt;e up, you'd simply drop the desire for it.sNEWLINEs



LISTEN AND UNLEARNsNEWLINEs
07sNEWLINEs

Some of us get wol&lt;en up by the harsh realities of life. We suffer sosNEWLINEs
much that we wal&lt;e up. But people l&lt;eep bumping again and againsNEWLINEs
into life. They still go on sleepwaking. They never wal&lt;e up.sNEWLINEs
Tragically, it never occurs to them that there may be another way. ItsNEWLINEs
never occurs to them that there may be a better way. Still, if yousNEWLINEs
haven't been bumped sufficiently by life, and you haven't sufferedsNEWLINEs
enough, then there is another way: to listen. I don't mean you havesNEWLINEs
to agree with what I 'm saying.sNEWLINEs

That wouldn't be listening. Believe me, it really doesn't mattersNEWLINEs
whether you agree with what I 'm saying or you don't. BecausesNEWLINEs
agreement and disagreement have to do with words and conceptssNEWLINEs
and theories. They don't have anything to do with truth. Truth issNEWLINEs
never expressed in words. Truth is sighted suddenly, as a result of asNEWLINEs
certain attitude. So you could be disagreeing with me and still sightsNEWLINEs
the truth. But there has to be an attitude of openness, of willingnesssNEWLINEs
to discover something new. That's important, not your agreeing withsNEWLINEs
me or disagreeing with me. After all, most of what I 'm giving you issNEWLINEs
really theories.sNEWLINEs

No theory adequately covers reality. So I can speak to you, not of thesNEWLINEs
truth, but of obstacles to the truth. Those I can describe. I cannotsNEWLINEs
describe the truth. No one can. All I can do is give you a descriptionsNEWLINEs
of your falsehoods, so that you can drop them. All I can do for you issNEWLINEs
challenge your beliefs and the belief system that makes you unhappy.sNEWLINEs
All I can do for you is help you to unlearn. That's what learning is allsNEWLINEs
about where spirituality is concerned: unlearning, unlearning almostsNEWLINEs
everything you've been taught. A willingness to unlearn, to listen.sNEWLINEs

Are you listening, as most people do, in order to confirm what yousNEWLINEs
already think? Observe your reactions as I talk. Frequently you'll besNEWLINEs







Startled or shocked or scandalized or irritated or annoyed orsNEWLINEs
frustrated. Or you'll be saying, "Great! " But are you listening forsNEWLINEs
what will confirm what you already think? Or are you listening insNEWLINEs
order to discover something new? That is important. It is difficult forsNEWLINEs
sleeping people. Jesus proclaimed the good news, yet he wassNEWLINEs
rejected. Not because it was good, but because it was new. We hatesNEWLINEs
the new. We hate it! And the sooner we face up to that fact, thesNEWLINEs
better. We don't want new things, particularly when they'resNEWLINEs
disturbing, particularly when they involve change. Most particularly ifsNEWLINEs
it involves saying, "I was wrong".sNEWLINEs

I remember meeting an eighty-seven-year-old Jesuit in Spain; he'dsNEWLINEs
been my professor and rector in India thirty or forty years ago. AndsNEWLINEs
he attended a workshop like this. "I should have heard you speaksNEWLINEs
sixty years ago", he said. "You know something. I've been wrong allsNEWLINEs
my life". God, to listen to that! It's like looking at one of the wonderssNEWLINEs
of the world. That, ladies and gentlemen, is faith!sNEWLINEs

An openness to the truth, no matter what the consequences, nosNEWLINEs
matter where it leads you and when you don't even know where it'ssNEWLINEs
going to lead you. That's faith. Not belief, but faith. Your beliefs givesNEWLINEs
you a lot of security, but faith is insecurity. You don't know. You'resNEWLINEs
ready to follow and you're open, you're wide open! You're ready tosNEWLINEs
listen. And, mind you, being open does not mean being gullible, itsNEWLINEs
doesn't mean swallowing whatever the speaker is saying. Oh no.sNEWLINEs

You've got to challenge everything I'm saying. But challenge it fromsNEWLINEs
an attitude of openness, not from an attitude of stubbornness. AndsNEWLINEs
challenge it all. Recall those lovely words of Buddha when he said,sNEWLINEs
"Monks and scholars must not accept my words out of respect, butsNEWLINEs
must analyze them the way a goldsmith analyzes-gold by cutting,sNEWLINEs
scraping, rubbing, melting". When you do that, you're listening.sNEWLINEs
You've taken another major step toward awakening. The first step, assNEWLINEs
I said, was a readiness to admit that you don't want to wake up, thatsNEWLINEs
you don't want to be happy. There are all kinds of resistances to thatsNEWLINEs
within you. The second step is a readiness to understand, to listen, tosNEWLINEs
challenge your whole belief system. Not just your religious beliefs,sNEWLINEs
your political beliefs, your social beliefs, your psychological beliefs,sNEWLINEs
but all of them. A readiness to reappraise them all, in the Buddha'ssNEWLINEs
metaphor. And I 'II give you plenty of opportunity to do that here.sNEWLINEs







THE MASQUERADE OF CHARITYsNEWLINEs

08sNEWLINEs

Charity is really self-interest masquerading under the form ofsNEWLINEs
altruism. You say that it is very difficult to accept that there may besNEWLINEs
times when you are not honest to goodness really trying to be lovingsNEWLINEs
or trustful. Let me simplify it. Let's make it as simple as possible.sNEWLINEs
Let's even make it as blunt and extreme as possible, at least to beginsNEWLINEs
with. There are two types of selfishness. The first type is the onesNEWLINEs
where I give myself the pleasure of pleasing myself. That's what wesNEWLINEs
generally call self-centeredness. The second is when I give myself thesNEWLINEs
pleasure of pleasing others. That would be a more refined kind ofsNEWLINEs
selfishness.sNEWLINEs

The first one is very obvious, but the second one is hidden, verysNEWLINEs
hidden, and for that reason more dangerous, because we get to feelsNEWLINEs
that we're really great. But maybe we're not all that great after all.sNEWLINEs
You protest when I say that. That's great! You, madam, you say that,sNEWLINEs
in your case, you live alone, and go to the rectory and give severalsNEWLINEs
hours of your time. But you also admit you're really doing it for asNEWLINEs
selfish reason - your need to be needed. And you also know you needsNEWLINEs
to be needed in a way that makes you feel like you're contributing tosNEWLINEs
the world a little bit. But you also claim that, because they also needsNEWLINEs
you to do this, it's a two-way street.sNEWLINEs

You're almost enlightened! We've got to learn from you. That's right.sNEWLINEs
She is saying, "I give something, I get something". She is right. I gosNEWLINEs
out to help, I give something, I get something. That's beautiful.sNEWLINEs
That's true. That's real. That isn't charity, that's enlightened self-sNEWLINEs
interest. And you, sir, you point out that the gospel of J esus issNEWLINEs
ultimately a gospel of self-interest. We achieve eternal life by our actssNEWLINEs
of charity. "Come blest of my Father, when I was hungry, you gavesNEWLINEs
me to eat", and so on. You say that perfectly confirms what I 've said.sNEWLINEs
When we look at Jesus, you say, we see that his acts of charity weresNEWLINEs
acts of ultimate self-interest, to win souls for eternal life. And you seesNEWLINEs
that as the whole thrust and meaning of life the achievement of self-sNEWLINEs
interest by acts of charity.sNEWLINEs

All right. But see, you are cheating a bit because you brought religionsNEWLINEs
into this. It's legitimate. It's valid. But how would it be if I deal withsNEWLINEs
the gospels, with the Bible, with Jesus, toward the END of thissNEWLINEs
retreat. I will say this much now to complicate it even more. "I wassNEWLINEs
hungry, and you gave me to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me tosNEWLINEs





drink", and what do they reply? "When? When did we do it? We didn'tsNEWLINEs
l&lt;now it". They were unconscious! I sometimes have a horrid fantasysNEWLINEs
where the l&lt;ing says, "I was hungry and you gave me to eat", and thesNEWLINEs
people on the right side say, "That's right. Lord, we KNOW". "I wasn'tsNEWLINEs
talking to you", the king tells them. "It doesn't follow the script;sNEWLINEs
you're not SUPPOSED to have known". Isn't that interesting?sNEWLINEs

But YOU know. You know the inner pleasure you have while doingsNEWLINEs
acts of charity. Aha!!! That's right! It's the opposite of someone whosNEWLINEs
says, "What's so great about what I did? I did something, I gotsNEWLINEs
something. I had no notion I was doing anything good. My left handsNEWLINEs
had no idea what my right hand was doing". You know, a good issNEWLINEs
never so good as when you have no awareness that you're doingsNEWLINEs
good. You are never so good as when you have no consciousness thatsNEWLINEs
you're good. Or as the great Sufi would say, "A saint is one until hesNEWLINEs
or she knows it". Unselfconscious! Unselfconscious!sNEWLINEs

Some of you object to this. You say, "Isn't the pleasure I receive insNEWLINEs
giving, isn't that eternal life right here and now"? I wouldn't know. IsNEWLINEs
call pleasure, pleasure, and nothing more. For the time being, at leastsNEWLINEs
until we get into religion later on. But I want you to understandsNEWLINEs
something right at the beginning, that religion is not - I repeat not -sNEWLINEs
necessarily connected with spirituality. Please keep religion out of thissNEWLINEs
for the time being.sNEWLINEs

All right, you ask, what about the soldier who falls on a grenade tosNEWLINEs
keep it from hurting others? And what about the man who got into asNEWLINEs
truck full of dynamite and drove into the American camp in Beirut?sNEWLINEs
How about him? "Greater love than this no one has". But thesNEWLINEs
Americans don't think so. He did it deliberately. He was terrible,sNEWLINEs
wasn't he? But he wouldn't think so, I assure you. He thought he wassNEWLINEs
going to heaven. That's right. J ust like your soldier falling on thesNEWLINEs
grenade.sNEWLINEs

I 'm trying to get at a picture of an action where there is not self,sNEWLINEs
where you're awake and what you do is done through you. Your deedsNEWLINEs
in that case becomes a happening. "Let it be done to me". I'm notsNEWLINEs
excluding that. But when YOU do it, I'm searching for the selfishness.sNEWLINEs
Even if it is only "I'll be remembered as a great hero", or "I'd neversNEWLINEs
be able to live if I didn't do this. I 'd never be able to live with thesNEWLINEs
thought if I ran away". But remember, I'm not excluding the othersNEWLINEs
kind of act.sNEWLINEs

I didn't say that there never is any act where there is not self. MaybesNEWLINEs





there is. We'll have to explore that. A mother saving a child - savingsNEWLINEs
HER child, you say. But how come she's not saving the neighbor'ssNEWLINEs
child? It's the HERS. It's the soldier dying for his country. Many suchsNEWLINEs
deaths bother me. I ask myself, "Are they the result ofsNEWLINEs
brainwashing"? Martyrs bother me. I think they're often brainwashed.sNEWLINEs
Muslim martyrs, Hindu martyrs, Buddhist martyrs. Christian martyrs,sNEWLINEs
they are brainwashed!sNEWLINEs

They've got an idea in their heads that they must die, that death is asNEWLINEs
great thing. They feel nothing, they go right in. But not all of them,sNEWLINEs
so listen to me properly. I didn't say ALL of them, but I wouldn'tsNEWLINEs
exclude the possibility. Lots of communists get brainwashed (you'resNEWLINEs
ready to believe that). They're so brainwashed they're ready to die.sNEWLINEs

I sometimes say to myself that the process that we use for making,sNEWLINEs
for example, a St. Francis Xavier could be exactly the same processsNEWLINEs
used for producing terrorists. You can have a man go on a thirty-daysNEWLINEs
retreat and come out all aflame with the love of Christ, yet withoutsNEWLINEs
the slightest bit of self-awareness. None. He could be a big pain. HesNEWLINEs
thinks he's a great saint. I don't mean to slander Francis Xavier, whosNEWLINEs
probably was a great saint, but he was a difficult man to live with.sNEWLINEs

You know he was a lousy superior, he really was! Do a historicalsNEWLINEs
investigation. Ignatius always had to step in to undo the harm thatsNEWLINEs
this good man was doing by his intolerance. You need to be prettysNEWLINEs
intolerant to achieve what he achieved. Go, go, go, go - no mattersNEWLINEs
how many corpses fall by the wayside. Some critics of Francis XaviersNEWLINEs
claim exactly that. He used to dismiss men from our Society andsNEWLINEs
they'd appeal to Ignatius, who would say, "Come to Rome and we'llsNEWLINEs
talk about it". And Ignatius surreptitiously got them in again. HowsNEWLINEs
much self-awareness was there in this situation? Who are we tosNEWLINEs
judge, we don't know.sNEWLINEs

I'm not saying there's no such thing as pure motivation. I'm sayingsNEWLINEs
that ordinarily everything we do is in our self-interest. Everything.sNEWLINEs
When you do something for the love of Christ, is that selfishness?sNEWLINEs
Yes. When you're doing something for the love of anybody, it is insNEWLINEs
your self-interest. I'll have to explain that.sNEWLINEs

Suppose you happen to live in Phoenix and you feed over fivesNEWLINEs
hundred children a day. That gives you a good feeling? Well, wouldsNEWLINEs
you expect it to give you a bad feeling? But sometimes it does. AndsNEWLINEs
that is because there are some people who do things so that theysNEWLINEs
won't HAVE TO HAVE A BAD FEELI NG. And they call THAT charity.sNEWLINEs





They act out of guilt. That isn't love. But, thank God, you do thingssNEWLINEs
for people and it's pleasurable. Wonderful! You're a healthy individualsNEWLINEs
because you're SELF-INTERESTED. That's healthy.sNEWLINEs

Let me summarize what I was saying about selfless charity. I saidsNEWLINEs
there were two types of selfishness; maybe I should have said three.sNEWLINEs
First, when I do something, or rather, when I give myself thesNEWLINEs
pleasure of pleasing myself; second, when I give myself the pleasuresNEWLINEs
of pleasing others. Don't take pride in that. Don't think you're a greatsNEWLINEs
person. You're a very ordinary person, but you've got refined tastes.sNEWLINEs

Your taste is good, not the quality of your spirituality. When you weresNEWLINEs
a child, you liked Coca-Cola; now you've grown older and yousNEWLINEs
appreciate chilled beer on a hot day. You've got better tastes now.sNEWLINEs
When you were a child, you loved chocolates; now you're older, yousNEWLINEs
enjoy a symphony, you enjoy a poem. You've got better tastes. ButsNEWLINEs
you're getting your pleasure all the same, except now it's in thesNEWLINEs
pleasure of pleasing others.sNEWLINEs

Then you've got the third type, which is the worst when you dosNEWLINEs
something good so that you won't get a bad feeling. It doesn't givesNEWLINEs
you a good feeling to do it; it gives you a bad feeling to do it. YousNEWLINEs
hate it. You're making loving sacrifices but you're grumbling. Ha! HowsNEWLINEs
little you know of yourself if you think you don't do things this way.sNEWLINEs

If I had a dollar for every time I did things that gave me a badsNEWLINEs
feeling, I'd be a millionaire by now. You know how it goes. "Could IsNEWLINEs
meet you tonight. Father"? "Yes, come on in!" I don't want to meetsNEWLINEs
him and I hate meeting him. I want to watch that TV show tonight,sNEWLINEs
but how do I say no to him? I don't have the guts to say no. "ComesNEWLINEs
on in", and I 'm thinking, "Oh God, I 've got to put up with this pain".sNEWLINEs

It doesn't give me a good feeling to meet with him and it doesn't givesNEWLINEs
me a good feeling to say no to him, so I choose the lesser of the twosNEWLINEs
evils and I say, "O.K., come on in". I'm going to be happy when thissNEWLINEs
thing is over and I 'II be able to take my smile off, but I start thesNEWLINEs
session with him "How are you"? "Wonderful", he says, and he goessNEWLINEs
on and on about how he loves that workshop, and I'm thinking, "OhsNEWLINEs
God, when is he going to come to the point"?sNEWLINEs

Finally he comes to the point, and I metaphorically slam him againstsNEWLINEs
the wall and say, "Well, any fool could solve that kind of problem",sNEWLINEs
and I send him out. "Whew! Got rid of him", I say. And the nextsNEWLINEs
morning at breakfast (because I'm feeling I was so rude) I go up tosNEWLINEs





him and say, "How's life"? And lie answers, "Pretty good". And hesNEWLINEs
adds, "You l&lt;now, what you said to me last night was a real help. CansNEWLINEs
I meet you today, after lunch"? Oh God!sNEWLINEs

That's the worst kind of charity, when you're doing something so yousNEWLINEs
won't get a bad feeling. You don't have the guts to say you want tosNEWLINEs
be left alone. You want people to think you're a good priest! WhensNEWLINEs
you say, "I don't like hurting people", I say, "Come off it! I don'tsNEWLINEs
believe you". I don't believe anyone who says that he or she does notsNEWLINEs
like hurting people. We love to hurt people, especially some people.sNEWLINEs
We love it.sNEWLINEs

And when someone else is doing the hurting we rejoice in it. But wesNEWLINEs
don't want to do the hurting ourselves because we'll get hurt! Ah,sNEWLINEs
there it is. If we do the hurting, others will have a bad opinion of us.sNEWLINEs
They won't like us, they'll talk against us and we don't like that!sNEWLINEs



WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?sNEWLINEs
09sNEWLINEs

Life is a banquet. And the tragedy is that most people are starving tosNEWLINEs
death. That's what I 'm really talking about. There's a nice story aboutsNEWLINEs
some people who were on a raft off the coast of Brazil perishing fromsNEWLINEs
thirst. They had no idea that the water they were floating on wassNEWLINEs
fresh water. The river was coming out into the sea with such forcesNEWLINEs
that it went out for a couple of miles, so they had fresh water rightsNEWLINEs
there where they were. But they had no idea. In the same way, we'resNEWLINEs
surrounded with joy, with happiness, with love. Most people have nosNEWLINEs
idea of this whatsoever.sNEWLINEs

The reason - They're brainwashed. The reason - They're hypnotized;sNEWLINEs
they're asleep. Imagine a stage magician who hypnotizes someone sosNEWLINEs
that the person sees what is not there and does not see what issNEWLINEs
there. That's what it's all about. Repent and accept the good news.sNEWLINEs
Repent! Wake up! Don't weep for your sins. Why weep for sins thatsNEWLINEs
you committed when you were asleep? Are you going to cry becausesNEWLINEs
of what you did in your hypnotized state?sNEWLINEs

Why do you want to identify with a person like this? Wake up! WakesNEWLINEs
up! Repent! Put on a new mind. Take on a new way of looking atsNEWLINEs
things! For "the kingdom is here!" It's the rare Christian who takessNEWLINEs





that seriously. I said to you that the first thing you need to do issNEWLINEs
wal&lt;e up, to face the fact that you don't lil&lt;e being wol&lt;en up. You'dsNEWLINEs
much rather have all of the things which you were hypnotized intosNEWLINEs
believing are so precious to you, so important to you, so importantsNEWLINEs
for your life and your survival.sNEWLINEs

Second, understand. Understand that maybe you've got the wrongsNEWLINEs
ideas and it is these ideas that are influencing your life and making itsNEWLINEs
the mess that it is and keeping you asleep. Ideas about love, ideassNEWLINEs
about freedom, ideas about happiness, and so forth. And it isn't easysNEWLINEs
to listen to someone who would challenge those ideas of yours whichsNEWLINEs
have come to be so precious to you.sNEWLINEs

There have been some interesting studies in brainwashing. It hassNEWLINEs
been shown that you're brainwashed when you take on or "introject"sNEWLINEs
an idea that isn't yours, that is someone else's. And the funny thing issNEWLINEs
that you'll be ready to die for this idea. Isn't that strange? The firstsNEWLINEs
test of whether you've been brainwashed and have introjectedsNEWLINEs
convictions and beliefs occurs the moment they're attacked.sNEWLINEs

You feel stunned, you react emotionally. That's a pretty good sign -sNEWLINEs
not infallible, but a pretty good sign - that we're dealing withsNEWLINEs
brainwashing. You're ready to die for an idea that never was yours.sNEWLINEs
Terrorists or saints (so called) take on an idea, swallow it whole, andsNEWLINEs
are ready to die for it. It's not easy to listen, especially when you getsNEWLINEs
emotional about an idea.sNEWLINEs

And even when you don't get emotional about it, it's not easy tosNEWLINEs
listen; you're always listening from your programming, from yoursNEWLINEs
conditioning, from your hypnotic state. You frequently interpretsNEWLINEs
everything that's being said in terms of your hypnotic state or yoursNEWLINEs
conditioning or your programming. Like this girl who's listening to asNEWLINEs
lecture on agriculture and says, "Excuse me, sir, you know I agreesNEWLINEs
with you completely that the best manure is aged horse manure.sNEWLINEs

Would you tell us how old the horse should optimally be"? See wheresNEWLINEs
she's coming from? We all have our positions, don't we? And wesNEWLINEs
listen from those positions. "Henry, how you've changed! You were sosNEWLINEs
tall and you've grown so short. You were so well built and you'vesNEWLINEs
grown so thin. You were so fair and you've become so dark. WhatsNEWLINEs
happened to you, Henry"? Henry says, "I 'm not Henry. I 'm J ohn".sNEWLINEs
"Oh, you changed your name too!" How do you get people like that tosNEWLINEs
listen?sNEWLINEs







The most difficult tiling in the worid is to listen, to see. We don't wantsNEWLINEs
to see. Do you thinl&lt; a capitalist wants to see what is good in thesNEWLINEs
communist system? Do you think a communist wants to see what issNEWLINEs
good and healthy in the capitalist system? Do you think a rich mansNEWLINEs
wants to look at poor people? We don't want to look, because if wesNEWLINEs
do, we may change. We don't want to look. If you look, you losesNEWLINEs
control of the life that you are so precariously holding together.sNEWLINEs

And so in order to wake up, the one thing you need the most is notsNEWLINEs
energy, or strength, or youthfulness, or even great intelligence. ThesNEWLINEs
one thing you need most of all is the readiness to learn somethingsNEWLINEs
new. The chances that you will wake up are in direct proportion to thesNEWLINEs
amount of truth you can take without running away. How much aresNEWLINEs
you ready to take? How much of everything you've held dear are yousNEWLINEs
ready to have shattered, without running away? How ready are yousNEWLINEs
to think of something unfamiliar?sNEWLINEs

The first reaction is one of fear. It's not that we fear the unknown.sNEWLINEs
You cannot fear something that you do not know. Nobody is afraid ofsNEWLINEs
the unknown. What you really fear is the loss of the known. That'ssNEWLINEs
what you fear. By way of an example, I made the point thatsNEWLINEs
everything we do is tainted with selfishness. That isn't easy to hear.sNEWLINEs
But think now for a minute, let's go a little deeper into that. IfsNEWLINEs
everything you do comes from self-interest, enlightened or otherwise,sNEWLINEs
how does that make you feel about all your charity and all your goodsNEWLINEs
deeds? What happens to those? Here's a little exercise for you. ThinksNEWLINEs
of all the good deeds you've done, or of some of them (because I 'msNEWLINEs
only giving you a few seconds). Now understand that they reallysNEWLINEs
sprang from self-interest, whether you knew it or not.sNEWLINEs

What happens to your pride? What happens to your vanity? WhatsNEWLINEs
happens to that good feeling you gave yourself, that pat on the backsNEWLINEs
every time you did something that you thought was so charitable? ItsNEWLINEs
gets flattened out, doesn't it? What happens to that looking downsNEWLINEs
your nose at your neighbor who you thought was so selfish? ThesNEWLINEs
whole thing changes, doesn't it? "Well", you say, "my neighbor hassNEWLINEs
coarser tastes than I do". You're the more dangerous person, yousNEWLINEs
really are. J esus Christ seems to have had less trouble with the othersNEWLINEs
type than with your type. Much less trouble. He ran into trouble withsNEWLINEs
people who were really convinced they were good.sNEWLINEs

Other types didn't seem to give him much trouble at all, the onessNEWLINEs
who were openly selfish and knew it. Can you see how liberating thatsNEWLINEs
is? Hey, wake up! It's liberating. It's wonderful! Are you feelingsNEWLINEs





depressed? Maybe you are. Isn't it wonderful to realize you're nosNEWLINEs
better than anybody else in this world? Isn't it wonderful? Are yousNEWLINEs
disappointed? Look what we've brought to light! What happens tosNEWLINEs
your vanity? You'd like to give yourself a good feeling that you'resNEWLINEs
better than others. But look how we brought a fallacy to light!sNEWLINEs



GOOD BAD OR LUCKYsNEWLINEs
10sNEWLINEs

To me, selfishness seems to come out of an instinct for self-sNEWLINEs
preservation, which is our deepest and first instinct. How can we optsNEWLINEs
for selflessness? It would be almost like opting for non-being. To me,sNEWLINEs
it would seem to be the same thing as non-being. Whatever it is, I 'msNEWLINEs
saying: Stop feeling bad about being selfish; we're all the same.sNEWLINEs
Someone once had a terribly beautiful thing to say about Jesus.sNEWLINEs

This person wasn't even Christian. He said, "The lovely thing aboutsNEWLINEs
Jesus was that he was so at home with sinners, because hesNEWLINEs
understood that he wasn't one bit better than they were". We differsNEWLINEs
from others - from criminals, for example - only in what we do orsNEWLINEs
don't do, NOT I N WHAT WE ARE. The only difference between J esussNEWLINEs
and those others was that he was awake and they weren't. Look atsNEWLINEs
people who win the lottery.sNEWLINEs

Do they say, "I 'm so proud to accept this prize, not for myself, but forsNEWLINEs
my nation and my society". Does anybody talk like that when theysNEWLINEs
win the lottery? No. Because they were LUCKY, LUCKY. So they wonsNEWLINEs
the lottery, first prize. Anything to be proud of in that?sNEWLINEs

In the same way, if you achieved enlightenment, you would do so insNEWLINEs
the interest of self and you would be lucky. Do you want to glory insNEWLINEs
that? What's there to glory about? Can't you see how utterly stupid itsNEWLINEs
is to be vain about your good deeds? The Pharisee wasn't an evilsNEWLINEs
man, he was a stupid man. He was stupid, not evil. He didn't stop tosNEWLINEs
think. Someone once said, "I dare not stop to think, because if I did,sNEWLINEs
I wouldn't know how to get started again".sNEWLINEs

OUR ILLUSION ABOUT OTHERSsNEWLINEs

11sNEWLINEs

So if you stop to think, you would see tiiat tiiere's notiiing to be verysNEWLINEs
proud of after all. What does this do to your relationship with people?sNEWLINEs
What are you complaining about? A young man came to complainsNEWLINEs
that his girlfriend had let him down, that she had played false. WhatsNEWLINEs
are you complaining about? Did you expect any better? Expect thesNEWLINEs
worst, you're dealing with selfish people. You're the idiot - yousNEWLINEs
glorified her, didn't you?sNEWLINEs

You thought she was a princess, you thought people were nice.sNEWLINEs
They're not! They're not nice. They're as bad as you are - bad, yousNEWLINEs
understand? They're asleep like you. And what do you think they aresNEWLINEs
going to seek? Their own self-interest, exactly like you. No difference.sNEWLINEs
Can you imagine how liberating it is that you'll never be disillusionedsNEWLINEs
again, never be disappointed again? You'll never feel let down again.sNEWLINEs
Never feel rejected. Want to wake up? You want happiness? You wantsNEWLINEs
freedom? Here it is: Drop your false ideas. See through people. If yousNEWLINEs
see through yourself, you will see through everyone. Then you willsNEWLINEs
love them. Otherwise you spend the whole time grappling with yoursNEWLINEs
wrong notions of them, with your illusions that are constantlysNEWLINEs
crashing against reality.sNEWLINEs

It's probably too startling for many of you to understand thatsNEWLINEs
everyone except the very rare awakened person can be expected tosNEWLINEs





be selfish and to seek his or her own self-interest whether in coarsesNEWLINEs
or in refined ways. This leads you to see that there's nothing to besNEWLINEs
disappointed about, nothing to be disillusioned about. If you had beensNEWLINEs
in touch with reality all along, you would never have beensNEWLINEs
disappointed. But you chose to paint people in glowing colors; yousNEWLINEs
chose not to see through human beings because you chose not to seesNEWLINEs
through yourself. So you're paying the price now.sNEWLINEs

Before we discuss this, let me tell you a story. Somebody once asked,sNEWLINEs
"What is enlightenment like? What is awakening like"? It's like thesNEWLINEs
tramp in London who was settling in for the night. He'd hardly beensNEWLINEs
able to get a crust of bread to eat. Then he reaches this embankmentsNEWLINEs
on the river Thames. There was a slight drizzle, so he huddled in hissNEWLINEs
old tattered cloak. He was about to go to sleep when suddenly asNEWLINEs
chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce pulls up. Out of the car steps a beautifulsNEWLINEs
young lady who says to him, "My poor man, are you planning onsNEWLINEs
spending the night here on this embankment"?sNEWLINEs

And the tramp says, "Yes". She says, "I won't have it. You're comingsNEWLINEs
to my house and you're going to spend a comfortable night andsNEWLINEs
you're going to get a good dinner". She insists on his getting into thesNEWLINEs
car. Well, they ride out of London and get to a place where she has asNEWLINEs
sprawling mansion with large grounds. They are ushered in by thesNEWLINEs
butler, to whom she says, "James, please make sure he's put in thesNEWLINEs
servants' quarters and treated well". Which is what James does. ThesNEWLINEs
young lady had undressed and was about to go to bed when shesNEWLINEs
suddenly remembers her guest for the night.sNEWLINEs

So she slips something on and pads along the corridor to thesNEWLINEs
servants' quarters. She sees a little chink of light from the roomsNEWLINEs
where the tramp was put up. She taps lightly at the door, opens it,sNEWLINEs
and finds the man awake. She says, "What's the trouble, my goodsNEWLINEs
man, didn't you get a good meal"? He said, "Never had a better mealsNEWLINEs
in my life, lady". "Are you warm enough"? He says, "Yes, lovely warmsNEWLINEs
bed". Then she says, "Maybe you need a little company. Why don'tsNEWLINEs
you move over a bit". And she comes closer to him and he movessNEWLINEs
over and falls right into the Thames.sNEWLINEs

Ha! You didn't expect that one! Enlightenment! Enlightenment! WakesNEWLINEs
up. When you're ready to exchange your illusions for reality, whensNEWLINEs
you're ready to exchange your dreams for facts, that's the way yousNEWLINEs
find it all. That's where life finally becomes meaningful. Life becomessNEWLINEs
beautiful. There's a story about Ramirez. He is old and living up theresNEWLINEs
in his castle on a hill. He looks out the window (he's in bed andsNEWLINEs





paralyzed) and he sees his enemy. Old as he is, leaning on a cane,sNEWLINEs
his enemy is climbing up the hill - slowly, painfully. It takes himsNEWLINEs
about two and a half hours to get up the hill.sNEWLINEs

There's nothing Ramirez can do because the servants have the daysNEWLINEs
off. So his enemy opens the door, comes straight to the bedroom,sNEWLINEs
puts his hand inside his cloak, and pulls out a gun. He says, "At last,sNEWLINEs
Ramirez, we're going to settle scores!" Ramirez tries his level best tosNEWLINEs
talk him out of it. He says, "Come on, Borgia, you can't do that. YousNEWLINEs
know I 'm no longer the man who ill-treated you as that youngstersNEWLINEs
years ago, and you're no longer that youngster. Come off it!" "OhsNEWLINEs
no", says his enemy, "your sweet words aren't going to deter mesNEWLINEs
from this divine mission of mine.sNEWLINEs

It's revenge I want and there's nothing you can do about it". AndsNEWLINEs
Ramirez says, "But there is!" "What"? asks his enemy. "I can wakesNEWLINEs
up", says Ramirez. And he did; he woke up! That's whatsNEWLINEs
enlightenment is like. When someone tells you, "There is nothing yousNEWLINEs
can do about it", you say, "There is, I can wake up!" All of a sudden,sNEWLINEs
life is no longer the nightmare that it has seemed. Wake up!sNEWLINEs

Somebody came up to me with a question. What do you think thesNEWLINEs
question was? He asked me, "Are you enlightened"? What do yousNEWLINEs
think my answer was? What does it matter! You want a bettersNEWLINEs
answer? My answer would be: "How would I know? How would yousNEWLINEs
know? What does it matter"? You know something? If you wantsNEWLINEs
anything too badly, you're in big trouble. You know something else?sNEWLINEs
If I were enlightened and you listened to me because I wassNEWLINEs
enlightened, then you're in big trouble.sNEWLINEs

Are you ready to be brainwashed by someone who's enlightened? YousNEWLINEs
can be brainwashed by anybody, you know. What does it mattersNEWLINEs
whether someone's enlightened or not? But see, we want to lean onsNEWLINEs
someone, don't we? We want to lean on anybody we think hassNEWLINEs
arrived. We love to hear that people have arrived. It gives us hope,sNEWLINEs
doesn't it? What do you want to hope for? Isn't that another form ofsNEWLINEs
desire? You want to hope for something better than what you havesNEWLINEs
right now, don't you? Otherwise you wouldn't be hoping. But then,sNEWLINEs
you forget that you have it all right now anyway, and you don't knowsNEWLINEs
it. Why not concentrate on the now instead of hoping for better timessNEWLINEs
in the future? Why not understand the now instead of forgetting itsNEWLINEs
and hoping for the future? Isn't the future just another trap?sNEWLINEs









SELF-OBSERVATIONsNEWLINEs
12sNEWLINEs

The only way someone can be of help to you is in challenging yoursNEWLINEs
ideas. If you're ready to listen and if you're ready to be challenged,sNEWLINEs
there's one thing that you can do, but NO ONE CAN HELP YOU. WhatsNEWLINEs
is this most important thing of all? It's called self-observation. No onesNEWLINEs
can help you there. No one can give you a method. No one can showsNEWLINEs
you a technique. The moment you pick up a technique, you'resNEWLINEs
programmed again. But self-observation - watching yourself - issNEWLINEs
important. It is not the same as self-absorption.sNEWLINEs

Self-absorption is self- preoccupation, where you're concerned aboutsNEWLINEs
yourself, worried about yourself. I'm talking about self-sNEWLINEs
OBSERVATION. What's that? It means to watch everything in you andsNEWLINEs
around you as far as possible and watch it as if it were happening tosNEWLINEs
someone else. What does that last sentence mean? It means that yousNEWLINEs
do not personalize what is happening to you. It means that you looksNEWLINEs
at things as if you have no connection with them whatsoever.sNEWLINEs

The reason you suffer from your depression and your anxieties is thatsNEWLINEs
you identify with them. You say, "I'm depressed". But that is false.sNEWLINEs
You are not depressed. If you want to be accurate, you might say, "IsNEWLINEs
am experiencing a depression right now". But you can hardly say, "IsNEWLINEs
am depressed". You are not your depression. That is but a strangesNEWLINEs
kind of tuck of the mind, a strange kind of illusion.sNEWLINEs

You have deluded yourself into thinking - though you are not awaresNEWLINEs
of it - that you ARE your depression, that you ARE your anxiety, thatsNEWLINEs
you ARE your joy or the thrills that you have. "I am delighted!" YousNEWLINEs
certainly are not delighted. Delight may be IN you right now, but waitsNEWLINEs
around, it will change. It won't last: it never lasts; it keeps changing;sNEWLINEs
it's always changing. Clouds come and go: some of them are blacksNEWLINEs
and some white, some of them are large, others small. If we want tosNEWLINEs
follow the analogy, you would be the sky, observing the clouds. YousNEWLINEs
are a passive, detached observer. That's shocking, particularly tosNEWLINEs
someone in the Western culture. You're not interfering. Don'tsNEWLINEs
interfere. Don't "fix" anything. Watch! Observe! The trouble withsNEWLINEs
people is that they're busy fixing things they don't even understand.sNEWLINEs
We're always fixing things, aren't we? It never strikes us that thingssNEWLINEs
don't need to be fixed. They really don't. This is a great illumination.sNEWLINEs
They need to be understood. If you understood them, they'd change.sNEWLINEs







AWARENESS WITHOUT EVALUATING EVERYTHINGsNEWLINEs

13sNEWLINEs

Do you want to change the world? How about beginning withsNEWLINEs
yourself? How about being transformed yourself first? But how do yousNEWLINEs
achieve that? Through observation. Through understanding. With nosNEWLINEs
interference or judgment on your part. Because what you judge yousNEWLINEs
cannot understand. When you say of someone, "He's a communist",sNEWLINEs
understanding has stopped at that moment. You slapped a label onsNEWLINEs
him. "She's a capitalist". Understanding has stopped at that moment.sNEWLINEs
You slapped a label on her, and if the label carries undertones ofsNEWLINEs
approval or disapproval, so much the worse! How are you going tosNEWLINEs
understand what you disapprove of, or what you approve of, for thatsNEWLINEs
matter? All of this sounds like a new world, doesn't it?sNEWLINEs

No judgment, no commentary, no attitude: one simply observes, onesNEWLINEs
studies, one watches, without the desire to change what is. BecausesNEWLINEs
if you desire to change what is into what you think SHOULD be, yousNEWLINEs
no longer understand. A dog trainer attempts to understand a dog sosNEWLINEs
that he can train the dog to perform certain tricks. A scientistsNEWLINEs
observes the behavior of ants with no further end in view than tosNEWLINEs
study ants, to learn as much as possible about them. He has no othersNEWLINEs
aim. He's not attempting to train them or get anything out of them.sNEWLINEs
He's interested in ants, he wants to learn as much as possible aboutsNEWLINEs
them. That's his attitude. The day you attain a posture like that, yousNEWLINEs
will experience a miracle. You will change - effortlessly, correctly.sNEWLINEs
Change will happen, you will not have to bring it about. As the life ofsNEWLINEs
awareness settles on your darkness, whatever is evil will disappear.sNEWLINEs
Whatever is good will be fostered. You will have to experience that forsNEWLINEs
yourself.sNEWLINEs

But this calls for a disciplined mind. And when I say disciplined, I'msNEWLINEs
not talking about effort. I'm talking about something else. Have yousNEWLINEs
ever studied an athlete. His or her whole life is sports, but what asNEWLINEs
disciplined life he or she leads. And look at a river as it moves towardsNEWLINEs
the sea. It creates its own banks that contain it. When there'ssNEWLINEs
something within you that moves in the right direction, it creates itssNEWLINEs
own discipline. The moment you get bitten by the bug of awareness.sNEWLINEs
Oh, it's so delightful! It's the most delightful thing in the world; thesNEWLINEs





most important, the most delightful. There's nothing so important insNEWLINEs
the world as awakening. Nothing! And, of course, it is also disciplinesNEWLINEs
in its own way.sNEWLINEs

There's nothing so delightful as being aware. Would you rather live insNEWLINEs
darkness? Would you rather act and not be aware of your actions,sNEWLINEs
talk and not be aware of your words? Would you rather listen tosNEWLINEs
people and not be aware of what you're hearing, or see things andsNEWLINEs
not be aware of what you're looking at? The great Socrates said, "ThesNEWLINEs
unaware life is not worth living". That's a self-evident truth. MostsNEWLINEs
people don't live aware lives. They live mechanical lives, mechanicalsNEWLINEs
thoughts - generally somebody else's - mechanical emotions,sNEWLINEs
mechanical actions, mechanical reactions.sNEWLINEs

Do you want to see how mechanical you really are? "My, that's asNEWLINEs
lovely shirt you're wearing". You feel good hearing that. For a shirt,sNEWLINEs
for heaven's sake! You feel proud of yourself when you hear that.sNEWLINEs
People come over to my center in I ndia and they say, "What a lovelysNEWLINEs
place, these lovely trees" (for which I'm not responsible at all), "thissNEWLINEs
lovely climate". And already I'm feeling good, until I catch myselfsNEWLINEs
feeling good, and I say, "Hey, can you imagine anything as stupid assNEWLINEs
that"? I 'm not responsible for those trees; I wasn't responsible forsNEWLINEs
choosing the location. I didn't order the weather; it just happened.sNEWLINEs

But "me" got in there, so I'm feeling good. I'm feeling good aboutsNEWLINEs
"my" culture and "my" nation. How stupid can you get? I mean that.sNEWLINEs
I'm told my great Indian culture has produced all these mystics. IsNEWLINEs
didn't produce them. I 'm not responsible for them. Or they tell me,sNEWLINEs
"That country of yours and its poverty - it's disgusting". I feelsNEWLINEs
ashamed. But I didn't create it. What's going on? Did you ever stop tosNEWLINEs
think? People tell you, "I think you're very charming", so I feelsNEWLINEs
wonderful. I get a positive stroke (that's why they call it I 'm O.K.,sNEWLINEs
you're O.K.). I'm going to write a book someday and the title will besNEWLINEs
I'M AN ASS, YOU'RE AN ASS. That's the most liberating, wonderfulsNEWLINEs
thing in the world, when you openly admit you're an ass. It'ssNEWLINEs
wonderful. When people tell me, "You're wrong". I say, "What cansNEWLINEs
you expect of an ass"?sNEWLINEs

Disarmed, everybody has to be disarmed. I n the final liberation, I 'msNEWLINEs
an ass, you're an ass. Normally the way it goes, I press a button andsNEWLINEs
you're up; I press another button and you're down. And you like that.sNEWLINEs
How many people do you know who are unaffected by praise orsNEWLINEs
blame? That isn't human, we say. Human means that you have to besNEWLINEs
a little monkey, so everybody can twist your tail, and you dosNEWLINEs





whatever you OUGHT to be doing. But is tiiat iiuman? If you find mesNEWLINEs
charming, it means that right now you're in a good mood, nothingsNEWLINEs
more. It also means that I fit your shopping list. We all carry asNEWLINEs
shopping list around, and it's as though you've got to measure up tosNEWLINEs
this list - tall, um, dark, um, handsome, according to MY tastes. "IsNEWLINEs
like the sound of his voice". You say, "I'm in love". You're not in love,sNEWLINEs
you silly ass. Any time you're in love - I hesitate to say this - you'resNEWLINEs
being particularly asinine. Sit down and watch what's happening tosNEWLINEs
you.sNEWLINEs

You're running away from yourself. You want to escape. SomebodysNEWLINEs
once said, "Thank God for reality, AND for the means to escape fromsNEWLINEs
it". So that's what's going on. We are so mechanical, so controlled.sNEWLINEs
We write books about being controlled and how wonderful it is to besNEWLINEs
controlled and how necessary it is that people tell you you're O.K.sNEWLINEs
Then you'll have a good feeling about yourself. How wonderful it is tosNEWLINEs
be in prison! Or as somebody said to me yesterday, to be in yoursNEWLINEs
cage. Do you like being in prison? Do you like being controlled? LetsNEWLINEs
me tell you something: If you ever let yourself feel good when peoplesNEWLINEs
tell you that you're O.K., you are preparing yourself to feel bad whensNEWLINEs
they tell you - you're not good. As long as you live to fulfill othersNEWLINEs
people's expectations, you better watch what you wear, how yousNEWLINEs
comb your hair, whether your shoes are polished - in short, whethersNEWLINEs
you live up to every damned expectation of theirs. Do you call thatsNEWLINEs
human?sNEWLINEs

This is what you'll discover when you observe yourself! You'll besNEWLINEs
horrified! The fact of the matter is that you're neither O.K. nor not O.sNEWLINEs
K. You may fit the current mood or trend or fashion! Does that meansNEWLINEs
you've become O.K.? Does your O.K.-ness depend on that? Does itsNEWLINEs
depend on what people think of you? J esus Christ must have beensNEWLINEs
pretty "not O.K". by those standards. You're not O.K. and you're notsNEWLINEs
not O.K., you're you.sNEWLINEs

I hope that is going to be the big discovery, at least for some of you.sNEWLINEs
If three or four of you make this discovery during these days wesNEWLINEs
spend together, my, what a wonderful thing! Extraordinary! Cut outsNEWLINEs
all the O.K. stuff and the not-O.K. stuff; cut out all the judgmentssNEWLINEs
and simply observe, watch. You'll make great discoveries. ThesesNEWLINEs
discoveries will change you. You won't have to make the slightestsNEWLINEs
effort, believe me.sNEWLINEs

This reminds me of this fellow in London after the war. He's sittingsNEWLINEs
with a parcel wrapped in brown paper in his lap; it's a big, heavysNEWLINEs





object. The bus conductor comes up to him and says, "What do yousNEWLINEs
have on your lap there"? And the man says, "This is an unexplodedsNEWLINEs
bomb. We dug it out of the garden and I 'm tal&lt;ing it to the policesNEWLINEs
station". The conductor says, "You don't want to carry that on yoursNEWLINEs
lap. Put it under the seat". Psychology and spirituality (as wesNEWLINEs
generally understand it) transfer the bomb from your lap to undersNEWLINEs
your seat. They don't really solve your problems. They exchange yoursNEWLINEs
problems for other problems. Has that ever struck you? You had asNEWLINEs
problem, now you exchange it for another one. It's always going tosNEWLINEs
be that way until we solve the problem called "you".sNEWLINEs



THE ILLUSION OF REWARDSsNEWLINEs
14sNEWLINEs

Until then, we're going to get nowhere. The great mystics andsNEWLINEs
masters in the East will say, "Who are YOU"? Many think the mostsNEWLINEs
important question in the world is: "Who is Jesus Christ"? Wrong!sNEWLINEs
Many think it is: "Does God exist"? Wrong! Many think it is: "Is theresNEWLINEs
a life after death"? Wrong! Nobody seems to be grappling with thesNEWLINEs
problem of: Is there a life BEFORE death?sNEWLINEs

Yet my experience is that it's precisely the ones who don't know whatsNEWLINEs
to do with THIS life who are all hot and bothered about what they aresNEWLINEs
going to do with ANOTHER life. One sign that you're awakened is thatsNEWLINEs
you don't give a damn about what's going to happen in the next life.sNEWLINEs
You're not bothered about it; you don't care. You are not interested,sNEWLINEs
period.sNEWLINEs

Do you know what eternal life is? You think it's everlasting life. ButsNEWLINEs
your own theologians will tell you that that is crazy, becausesNEWLINEs
everlasting is still within time. It is time perduring forever. EternalsNEWLINEs
means timeless no time. The human mind cannot understand that.sNEWLINEs
The human mind can understand time and can deny time. What issNEWLINEs
timeless is beyond our comprehension. Yet the mystics tell us thatsNEWLINEs
eternity is right now.sNEWLINEs

How's that for good news? It is right now. People are so distressedsNEWLINEs
when I tell them to forget their past. They are so proud of their past.sNEWLINEs
Or they are so ashamed of their past. They're crazy! J ust drop it!sNEWLINEs
When you hear "Repent for your past", realize it's a great religioussNEWLINEs
distraction from waking up. Wake up! That's what repent means. NotsNEWLINEs







"weep for your sins". Wake up! Understand, stop all the crying,sNEWLINEs
Understand! Wake up!sNEWLINEs



FINDING YOURSELFsNEWLINEs
15sNEWLINEs

The great masters tell us that the most important question in thesNEWLINEs
world is: "Who am I"? Or rather: "What is 'I'"? What is this thing I callsNEWLINEs
"I"? What is this thing I call self? You mean you understoodsNEWLINEs
everything else in the world and you didn't understand this? YousNEWLINEs
mean you under-stood astronomy and black holes and quasars andsNEWLINEs
you picked up computer science, and you don't know who you are?sNEWLINEs
My, you are still asleep. You are a sleeping scientist. You mean yousNEWLINEs
understood what Jesus Christ is and you don't know who you are?sNEWLINEs
How do you know that you have understood J esus Christ? Who is thesNEWLINEs
person doing the understanding?sNEWLINEs

Find that out first. That's the foundation of everything, isn't it? It'ssNEWLINEs
because we haven't understood this that we've got all these stupidsNEWLINEs
religious people involved in all these stupid religious wars -- MuslimssNEWLINEs
fighting against Jews, Protestants fighting Catholics, and all the restsNEWLINEs
of that rubbish. They don't know who they are, because if they did,sNEWLINEs
there wouldn't be wars. Like the little girl who says to a little boy,sNEWLINEs
"Are you a Presbyterian"? And he says, "No, we belong to anothersNEWLINEs
abomination!"sNEWLINEs

But what I'd like to stress right now is self-observation. You aresNEWLINEs
listening to me, but are you picking up any other sounds besides thesNEWLINEs
sound of my voice as you listen to me? Are you aware of YOURsNEWLINEs
reactions as you listen to me? If you aren't, you're going to besNEWLINEs
brainwashed. Or else you are going to be influenced by forces withinsNEWLINEs
you of which you have no awareness at all. And even if you're awaresNEWLINEs
of how you react to me, are you simultaneously aware of where yoursNEWLINEs
reaction is coming from? Maybe you are not listening to me at all;sNEWLINEs
maybe your daddy is listening to me. Do you think that's possible? OfsNEWLINEs
course it is.sNEWLINEs

Again and again in my therapy groups I come across people whosNEWLINEs
aren't there at all. Their daddy is there, their mummy is there, butsNEWLINEs
they're not there. They never were there. "I live now, not I, but mysNEWLINEs







daddy lives in me". Well, that's absolutely, literally true. I could takesNEWLINEs
you apart piece by piece and ask, "Now, this sentence, does it comesNEWLINEs
from Daddy, Mummy, Grandma, Grandpa, whom"? Who's living insNEWLINEs
you? It's pretty horrifying when you come to know that. You thinksNEWLINEs
you are free, but there probably isn't a gesture, a thought, ansNEWLINEs
emotion, an attitude, a belief in you that isn't coming from someonesNEWLINEs
else. Isn't that horrible? And you don't know it. Talk about asNEWLINEs
mechanical life that was stamped into you. You feel pretty stronglysNEWLINEs
about certain things, and you think it is you who are feeling stronglysNEWLINEs
about them, but are you really? It's going to take a lot of awarenesssNEWLINEs
for you to understand that perhaps this thing you call "I " is simply asNEWLINEs
conglomeration of your past experiences, of your conditioning andsNEWLINEs
programming.sNEWLINEs

That's painful. In fact, when you're beginning to awaken, yousNEWLINEs
experience a great deal of pain. It's painful to see your illusions beingsNEWLINEs
shattered. Everything that you thought you had built up crumbles andsNEWLINEs
that's painful. That's what repentance is all about; that's what wakingsNEWLINEs
up is all about. So how about taking a minute, right where you'resNEWLINEs
sitting now, to be aware, even as I talk, of what you're feeling in yoursNEWLINEs
body, and what's going on in your mind, and what your emotionalsNEWLINEs
state is like? How about being aware of the blackboard, if your eyessNEWLINEs
are open, and the color of these walls and the material they're madesNEWLINEs
of? How about being aware of my face and the reaction you have tosNEWLINEs
this face of mine? Because you have a reaction whether you're awaresNEWLINEs
of it or not. And it probably isn't your reaction, but one you weresNEWLINEs
conditioned to have. And how about being aware of some of thesNEWLINEs
things I just said, although that wouldn't be awareness, becausesNEWLINEs
that's just memory now.sNEWLINEs

Be aware of your presence in this room. Say to yourself, "I 'm in thissNEWLINEs
room". It's as if you were outside yourself looking at yourself. NoticesNEWLINEs
a slightly different feeling than if you were looking at things in thesNEWLINEs
room. Later we'll ask, "Who is this person who is doing the looking"? IsNEWLINEs
am looking at me. What's an "I "? What's "me"? For the time being it'ssNEWLINEs
enough that I watch me, but if you find yourself condemning yourselfsNEWLINEs
or approving yourself, don't stop the condemnation and don't stopsNEWLINEs
the judgment or approval, just watch it. I 'm condemning me; I 'msNEWLINEs
disapproving of me; I'm approving of me. Just look at it, period.sNEWLINEs
Don't try to change it! Don't say, "Oh, we were told not to do this".sNEWLINEs
J ust observe what's going on. As I said to you before, self-sNEWLINEs
observation means watching -- observing whatever is going on in yousNEWLINEs
and around you as if it were happening to someone else.sNEWLINEs









STRIPPING DOWN TO THE TsNEWLINEs
16sNEWLINEs

I suggest another exercise now. Would you write down on a piece ofsNEWLINEs
paper any brief way you would describe yourself - for example,sNEWLINEs
businessman, priest, human being. Catholic, Jew, anything. SomesNEWLINEs
write, I notice, things like, fruitful, searching pilgrim, competent,sNEWLINEs
alive, impatient, centered, flexible, reconciler, lover, member of thesNEWLINEs
human race, overly structured. This is the fruit, I trust, of observingsNEWLINEs
yourself. As if you were watching another person.sNEWLINEs

But notice, you've got "I" observing "me". This is an interestingsNEWLINEs
phenomenon that has never ceased to cause wonder to philosophers,sNEWLINEs
mystics, scientists, psychologists, that the "I" can observe "me". ItsNEWLINEs
would seem that animals are not able to do this at all. It would seemsNEWLINEs
that one needs a certain amount of intelligence to be able to do this.sNEWLINEs
What I'm going to give you now is not metaphysics; it is notsNEWLINEs
philosophy.sNEWLINEs

It is plain observation and common sense. The great mystics of thesNEWLINEs
East are really referring to that "I ", not to the "me". As a matter ofsNEWLINEs
fact, some of these mystics tell us that we begin first with things,sNEWLINEs
with an awareness of things; then we move on to an awareness ofsNEWLINEs
thoughts (that's the "me"); and finally we get to awareness of thesNEWLINEs
thinker. THINGS, THOUGHTS, THINKER. What we're really searchingsNEWLINEs
for is the thinker. Can the thinker know himself? Can I know what "I "sNEWLINEs
is? Some of these mystics reply, "Can the knife cut itself? Can thesNEWLINEs
tooth bite itself? Can the eye see itself? Can the 'I' know itself"? But IsNEWLINEs
am concerned with something infinitely more practical right now, andsNEWLINEs
that is with deciding what the "I " is not. I 'II go as slowly as possiblesNEWLINEs
because the consequences are devastating. Terrific or terrifying,sNEWLINEs
depending on your point of view.sNEWLINEs

Listen to this: Am I my thoughts, the thoughts that I am thinking?sNEWLINEs
No. Thoughts come and go; I am not my thoughts. Am I my body?sNEWLINEs
They tell us that millions of cells in our body are changed or aresNEWLINEs
renewed every minute, so that by the end of seven years we don'tsNEWLINEs
have a single living cell in our body that was there seven yearssNEWLINEs
before. Cells come and go. Cells arise and die. But "I" seems tosNEWLINEs
persist. So am I my body? Evidently not!sNEWLINEs







"I" is something otiier and more than the body. You might say thesNEWLINEs
body is part of "I", but it is a changing part. It l&lt;eeps moving, it l&lt;eepssNEWLINEs
changing. We have the same name for it but it constantly changes.sNEWLINEs
J ust as we have the same name for Niagara Falls, but Niagara Falls issNEWLINEs
constituted by water that is constantly changing. We use the samesNEWLINEs
name for an ever-changing reality. How about my name? I s "I " mysNEWLINEs
name? Evidently not, because I can change my name withoutsNEWLINEs
changing the "I". How about my career? How about my beliefs? I saysNEWLINEs
I am a Catholic, a J ew - is that an essential part of "I "? When I movesNEWLINEs
from one religion to another, has the "I" changed? Do I have a newsNEWLINEs
"I " or is it the same "I " that has changed? I n other words, is mysNEWLINEs
name an essential part of me, of the "I "? I s my religion an essentialsNEWLINEs
part of the "1"?sNEWLINEs

I mentioned the little girl who says to the boy, "Are you asNEWLINEs
Presbyterian"? Well, somebody told me another story, about Paddy.sNEWLINEs
Paddy was walking down the street in Belfast and he discovers a gunsNEWLINEs
pressing against the back of his head and a voice says". Are yousNEWLINEs
Catholic or Protestant"? Well, Paddy has to do some pretty fastsNEWLINEs
thinking. He says, "I 'm a J ew". And he hears a voice say, "I 've got tosNEWLINEs
be the luckiest Arab in the whole of Belfast". Labels are so importantsNEWLINEs
to us. "I am a Republican", we say. But are you really? You can'tsNEWLINEs
mean that when you switch parties you have a new "I". Isn't it thesNEWLINEs
same old "I" with new political convictions? I remember hearingsNEWLINEs
about a man who asks his friend, "Are you planning to votesNEWLINEs
Republican"? The friend says, "No, I'm planning to vote Democratic.sNEWLINEs

My father was a Democrat, my grandfather was a Democrat, and mysNEWLINEs
great-grandfather was a Democrat". The man says, "That is crazysNEWLINEs
logic. I mean, if your father was a horse thief, and your grandfathersNEWLINEs
was a horse thief, and your great-grandfather was a horse thief, whatsNEWLINEs
would you be"? "Ah", the friend answered, "then I 'd be a Republican".sNEWLINEs
We spend so much of our lives reacting to labels, our own andsNEWLINEs
others'. We identify the labels with the "I". Catholic and ProtestantsNEWLINEs
are frequent labels. There was a man who went to the priest andsNEWLINEs
said, "Father, I want you to say a Mass for my dog". The priest wassNEWLINEs
indignant. "What do you mean, say a Mass for your dog"? "It's mysNEWLINEs
pet dog", said the man. "I loved that dog and I'd like you to offer asNEWLINEs
Mass for him".sNEWLINEs

The priest said, "We don't offer Masses for dogs here. You might trysNEWLINEs
the denomination down the street. Ask them if they might have asNEWLINEs
service for you". As the man was leaving, he said to the priest, "ToosNEWLINEs





bad. I really loved that dog. I was planning to offer a million-dollarsNEWLINEs
stipend for the Mass". And the priest said, "Wait a minute, you neversNEWLINEs
told me your dog was Catholic". When you're caught up in labels,sNEWLINEs
what value do these labels have, as far as the "I" is concerned? CouldsNEWLINEs
we say that "I " is none of the labels we attach to it? Labels belong tosNEWLINEs
"me". What constantly changes is "me". Does "I" ever change? DoessNEWLINEs
the observer ever change? The fact is that no matter what labels yousNEWLINEs
think of (except perhaps human being) you should apply them tosNEWLINEs
"me". "I " is none of these things. So when you step out of yourselfsNEWLINEs
and observe "me", you no longer identify with "me". Suffering existssNEWLINEs
in "me", so when you identify "I" with "me", suffering begins.sNEWLINEs

Say that you are afraid or desirous or anxious. When "I " does notsNEWLINEs
identify with money, or name, or nationality, or persons, or friends,sNEWLINEs
or any quality, the "I " is never threatened. It can be very active, butsNEWLINEs
it isn't threatened. Think of anything that caused or is causing yousNEWLINEs
pain or worry or anxiety. First, can you pick up the desire under thatsNEWLINEs
suffering, that there's something you desire very keenly or else yousNEWLINEs
wouldn't be suffering. What is that desire? Second, it isn't simply asNEWLINEs
desire; there's an identification there. You have somehow said tosNEWLINEs
yourself, "The well-being of 'I ,' almost the existence of 'I ,' is tied upsNEWLINEs
with this desire". All suffering is caused by my identifying myself withsNEWLINEs
something, whether that something is within me or outside of me.sNEWLINEs



NEGATIVE FEELINGS TOWARD OTHERSsNEWLINEs

17sNEWLINEs

At one of my conferences, someone made the following observation:sNEWLINEs
"I want to share with you something wonderful that happened to me.sNEWLINEs
I went to the movies and I was working shortly after that and I wassNEWLINEs
really having trouble with three people in my life. So I said, 'All right,sNEWLINEs
just like I learned at the movies, I 'm going to come outside myself.sNEWLINEs
For a couple of hours, I got in touch with my feelings, with how badlysNEWLINEs
I felt toward these three people.sNEWLINEs

I said, 'I really hate those people.' Then I said, 'Jesus, what can yousNEWLINEs
do about all that?' A little while later I began to cry, because IsNEWLINEs
realized that J esus died for those very people and they couldn't helpsNEWLINEs
how they were, anyway. That afternoon I had to go to the office,sNEWLINEs
where I spoke to those people. I told them what my problem was andsNEWLINEs







they agreed with me. I wasn't mad at them and I didn't hate themsNEWLINEs
anymore".sNEWLINEs

Anytime you have a negative feeling toward anyone, you're living insNEWLINEs
an illusion. There's something seriously wrong with you. You're notsNEWLINEs
seeing reality. Something inside of you has to change. But what dosNEWLINEs
we generally do when we have a negative feeling? "He is to blame,sNEWLINEs
she is to blame. She's got to change". No! The world's all right. ThesNEWLINEs
one who has to change is YOU.sNEWLINEs

One of you told of working in an institution. During a staff meetingsNEWLINEs
someone would inevitably say, "The food stinks around here", andsNEWLINEs
the regular dietitian would go into orbit. She has identified with thesNEWLINEs
food. She is saying, "Anyone who attacks the food attacks me; I feelsNEWLINEs
threatened". But the "I " is never threatened; it's only the "me" that issNEWLINEs
threatened.sNEWLINEs

But suppose you witness some out-and-out injustice, something thatsNEWLINEs
is obviously and objectively wrong. Would it not be a proper reactionsNEWLINEs
to say this should not be happening? Should you somehow want tosNEWLINEs
involve yourself in correcting a situation that's wrong? Someone'ssNEWLINEs
injuring a child and you see abuse going on.sNEWLINEs

How about that kind of thing? I hope you did not assume that I wassNEWLINEs
saying you shouldn't do anything. I said that if you didn't havesNEWLINEs
negative feelings you'd be much more effective, MUCH moresNEWLINEs
effective. Because when negative feelings come in, you go blind. "Me"sNEWLINEs
steps into the picture, and everything gets fouled up. Where we hadsNEWLINEs
one problem on our hands before, now we have two problems. ManysNEWLINEs
wrongly assume that not having negative feelings like anger andsNEWLINEs
resentment and hate means that you do nothing about a situation.sNEWLINEs

Oh no, oh no! You are not affected emotionally but you spring intosNEWLINEs
action. You become very sensitive to things and people around you.sNEWLINEs
What kills the sensitivity is what many people would call thesNEWLINEs
conditioned self: when you so identify with "me" that there's toosNEWLINEs
much of "me" in it for you to see things objectively, with detachment.sNEWLINEs
It's very important that when you swing into action, you be able tosNEWLINEs
see things with detachment. But negative emotions prevent that.sNEWLINEs

What, then, would we call the kind of passion that motivates orsNEWLINEs
activates energy into doing something about objective evils?sNEWLINEs
Whatever it is, it is not a REACTION; it is action.sNEWLINEs







Some of you wonder if there is a gray area before sometiiingsNEWLINEs
becomes an attachment, before identification sets in. Say a friendsNEWLINEs
dies. It seems right and very human to feel some sadness about that.sNEWLINEs
But what reaction? Self-pity? What would you be grieving about?sNEWLINEs
Think about that. What I'm saying is going to sound terrible to you,sNEWLINEs
but I told you, I'm coming from another world. Your reaction issNEWLINEs
PERSONAL loss, right? Feeling sorry for "me" or for other people yoursNEWLINEs
friend might have brought joy to.sNEWLINEs

But that means you're feeling sorry for other people who are feelingsNEWLINEs
sorry for themselves. If they're not feeling sorry for themselves, whatsNEWLINEs
would they be feeling sorry for? We never feel grief when we losesNEWLINEs
something that we have allowed to be free, that we have neversNEWLINEs
attempted to possess. Grief is a sign that I made my happinesssNEWLINEs
depend on this thing or person, at least to some extent. We're sosNEWLINEs
accustomed to hear the opposite of this that what I say soundssNEWLINEs
inhuman, doesn't it?sNEWLINEs



ON DEPENDENCEsNEWLINEs
18sNEWLINEs

But it's what all the mystics in the past have been telling us. I'm notsNEWLINEs
saying that "me", the conditioned-self, will not sometimes fall into itssNEWLINEs
usual patterns. That's the way we've been conditioned. But it raisessNEWLINEs
the question whether it is conceivable to live a life in which you wouldsNEWLINEs
be so totally alone that you would depend on no one.sNEWLINEs

We all depend on one another for all kinds of things, don't we? WesNEWLINEs
depend on the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker.sNEWLINEs
Interdependence. That's fine! We set up society this way and we allotsNEWLINEs
different functions to different people for the welfare of everyone, sosNEWLINEs
that we will function better and live more effectively - at least wesNEWLINEs
hope so. But to depend on another psychologically - to depend onsNEWLINEs
another emotionally - what does that imply? It means to depend onsNEWLINEs
another human being for my happiness.sNEWLINEs

Think about that. Because if you do, the next thing you will be doing,sNEWLINEs
whether you're aware of it or not, is DEMANDING that other peoplesNEWLINEs
contribute to your happiness. Then there will be a next step - fear,sNEWLINEs
fear of loss, fear of alienation, fear of rejection, mutual control.sNEWLINEs
Perfect love casts out fear. Where there is love there are nosNEWLINEs





demands, no expectations, no dependency. I do not demand that yousNEWLINEs
make me happy; my happiness does not lie in you. If you were tosNEWLINEs
leave me, I will not feel sorry for myself; I enjoy your companysNEWLINEs
immensely, but I do not cling.sNEWLINEs

I enjoy it on a non-clinging basis. What I really enjoy is not you; it'ssNEWLINEs
something that's greater than both you and me. It is something that IsNEWLINEs
discovered, a kind of symphony, a kind of orchestra that plays onesNEWLINEs
melody in your presence, but when you depart, the orchestra doesn'tsNEWLINEs
stop. When I meet someone else, it plays another melody, which issNEWLINEs
also very delightful. And when I'm alone, it continues to play. There'ssNEWLINEs
a great repertoire and it never ceases to play.sNEWLINEs

That's what awakening is all about. That's also why we're hypnotized,sNEWLINEs
brainwashed, asleep. It seems terrifying to ask, but can you be saidsNEWLINEs
to love me if you cling to me and will not let me go? If you will not letsNEWLINEs
me be? Can you be said to love me if you need me psychologically orsNEWLINEs
emotionally for your happiness? This flies in the face of the universalsNEWLINEs
teaching of all the scriptures, of all religions, of all the mystics.sNEWLINEs

"How is it that we missed it for so many years"? I say to myselfsNEWLINEs
repeatedly "How come I didn't see it"? When you read those radicalsNEWLINEs
things in the scriptures, you begin to wonder: Is this man crazy? ButsNEWLINEs
after a while you begin to think everybody else is crazy. "Unless yousNEWLINEs
hate your father and mother, brothers and sisters, unless yousNEWLINEs
renounce and give up everything you possess, you cannot be mysNEWLINEs
disciple".sNEWLINEs

You must drop it all. Not physical renunciation, you understand;sNEWLINEs
that's easy. When your illusions drop, you're in touch with reality atsNEWLINEs
last, and believe me, you will never again be lonely, never again.sNEWLINEs
Loneliness is not cured by human company. Loneliness is cured bysNEWLINEs
contact with reality. Oh, I have so much to say about that. ContactsNEWLINEs
with reality, dropping one's illusions, making contact with the real.sNEWLINEs

Whatever it is, it has no name. We can only know it by dropping whatsNEWLINEs
is unreal. You can only know what aloneness is when you drop yoursNEWLINEs
clinging, when you drop your dependency. But the first step towardsNEWLINEs
that is that you see it as desirable. If you don't see it as desirable,sNEWLINEs
how will you get anywhere near it?sNEWLINEs

Think of the loneliness that is yours. Would human company eversNEWLINEs
take it away? It will only serve as a distraction. There's an emptinesssNEWLINEs
inside, isn't there? And when the emptiness surfaces, what do yousNEWLINEs







do? You run away, turn on the television, turn on the radio, read asNEWLINEs
bool&lt;, search for human company, seel&lt; entertainment, seel&lt;sNEWLINEs
distraction. Everybody does that. It's big business nowadays, ansNEWLINEs
organized industry to distract us and entertain us.sNEWLINEs



HOW HAPPINESS HAPPENSsNEWLINEs
19sNEWLINEs

Come home to yourself. Observe yourself. That's why I said earliersNEWLINEs
that self-observation is such a delightful and extraordinary thing.sNEWLINEs
After a while you don't have to make any effort, because, as illusionssNEWLINEs
begin to crumble, you begin to know things that cannot be described.sNEWLINEs
It's called happiness. Everything changes and you become addictedsNEWLINEs
to awareness.sNEWLINEs

There's the story of the disciple who went to the master and said,sNEWLINEs
"Could you give me a word of wisdom? Could you tell me somethingsNEWLINEs
that would guide me through my days"? It was the master's day ofsNEWLINEs
silence, so he picked up a pad. It said, "Awareness". When thesNEWLINEs
disciple saw it, he said, "This is too brief. Can you expand on it a bit"?sNEWLINEs
So the master took back the pad and wrote, "Awareness, awareness,sNEWLINEs
awareness". The disciple said, "Yes, but what does it mean"? ThesNEWLINEs
master took back the pad and wrote, "Awareness, awareness,sNEWLINEs
awareness means -- awareness".sNEWLINEs

That's what it is to watch yourself. No one can show you how to do it,sNEWLINEs
because he would be giving you a technique, he would besNEWLINEs
programming you. But watch yourself. When you talk to someone,sNEWLINEs
are you aware of it or are you simply identifying with it? When yousNEWLINEs
got angry with somebody, were you aware that you were angry orsNEWLINEs
were you simply identifying with your anger? Later, when you had thesNEWLINEs
time, did you study your experience and attempt to understand it?sNEWLINEs

Where did it come from? What brought it on? I don't know of anysNEWLINEs
other way to awareness. You only change what you understand. WhatsNEWLINEs
you do not understand and are not aware of, you repress. You don'tsNEWLINEs
change. But when you understand it, it changes. I am sometimessNEWLINEs
asked, "Is this growing in awareness a gradual thing, or is it asNEWLINEs
'whammo' kind of thing"? There are some lucky people who see thissNEWLINEs
in a flash. They just become aware. There are others who keepsNEWLINEs
growing into it, slowly, gradually, increasingly. They begin to seesNEWLINEs





things. Illusions drop away, fantasies are peeled away, and they startsNEWLINEs
to get in touch with facts. There's no general rule.sNEWLINEs

There's a famous story about the lion who came upon a flock ofsNEWLINEs
sheep and to his amazement found a lion among the sheep. It was asNEWLINEs
lion who had been brought up by the sheep ever since he was a cub.sNEWLINEs
It would bleat like a sheep and run around like a sheep. The lion wentsNEWLINEs
straight for him, and when the sheep lion stood in front of the realsNEWLINEs
one, he trembled in every limb. And the lion said to him, "What aresNEWLINEs
you doing among the sheep"? And the sheep-lion said, "I am asNEWLINEs
sheep". And the lion said, "Oh no you're not. You're coming with me".sNEWLINEs
So he took the sheep-lion to a pool and said, "Look!" And when thesNEWLINEs
sheep-lion looked at his reflection in the water, he let out a mightysNEWLINEs
roar, and in that moment he was transformed. He was never thesNEWLINEs
same again.sNEWLINEs

If you're lucky and the gods are gracious or if you are gifted withsNEWLINEs
divine grace (use any theological expression you want), you mightsNEWLINEs
suddenly understand who "I" is, and you will never be the samesNEWLINEs
again, never. Nothing will ever be able to touch you again and no onesNEWLINEs
will ever be able to hurt you again. You will fear no one and you willsNEWLINEs
fear nothing. Isn't that extraordinary? You'll live like a king, like asNEWLINEs
queen. This is what it means to live like royalty. Not rubbish likesNEWLINEs
getting your picture in the newspapers or having a lot of money.sNEWLINEs
That's a lot of rot. You fear no one because you're perfectly contentsNEWLINEs
to be nobody. You don't give a damn about success or failure. TheysNEWLINEs
mean nothing. Honor, disgrace, they mean nothing! If you make asNEWLINEs
fool of yourself, that means nothing either.sNEWLINEs

Isn't that a wonderful state to be in! Some people arrive at this goalsNEWLINEs
painstakingly, step by step, through months and weeks of self-sNEWLINEs
awareness. But I'll promise you this: I have not known a singlesNEWLINEs
person who gave time to being aware who didn't see a difference in asNEWLINEs
matter of weeks. The quality of their life changes, so they don't havesNEWLINEs
to take it on faith anymore. They see it; they're different. They reactsNEWLINEs
differently. In fact, they react less and act more. You see thingssNEWLINEs
you've never seen before. You're much more energetic, much moresNEWLINEs
alive. People think that if they had no cravings, they'd be likesNEWLINEs
deadwood. But in fact they'd lose their tension. Get rid of your fear ofsNEWLINEs
failure, your tensions about succeeding, you will be yourself. Relaxed.sNEWLINEs
You wouldn't be driving with your brakes on. That's what wouldsNEWLINEs
happen.sNEWLINEs

There's a lovely saying of Tranxu, a great Chinese sage, that I tooksNEWLINEs





the trouble to learn by heart. It goes: "When the archer shoots for nosNEWLINEs
particular prize, he has all his skills; when he shoots to win a brasssNEWLINEs
buckle, he is already nervous; when he shoots for a gold prize, hesNEWLINEs
goes blind, sees two targets, and is out of his mind. His skill has notsNEWLINEs
changed, but the prize divides him. He cares! He thinks more ofsNEWLINEs
winning than of shooting, and the need to win drains him of power".sNEWLINEs
Isn't that an image of what most people are? When you're living forsNEWLINEs
nothing, you've got all your skills, you've got all your energy, you'resNEWLINEs
relaxed, you don't care, it doesn't matter whether you win or lose.sNEWLINEs

Now there's HUMAN living for you. That's what life is all about. ThatsNEWLINEs
can only come from awareness. And in awareness you willsNEWLINEs
understand that honor doesn't mean a thing. It's a social convention,sNEWLINEs
that's all. That's why the mystics and the prophets didn't bother onesNEWLINEs
bit about it. Honor or disgrace meant nothing to them. They weresNEWLINEs
living in another world, in the world of the awakened. Success orsNEWLINEs
failure meant nothing to them. They had the attitude: "I'm an ass,sNEWLINEs
you're an ass, so where's the problem"? Someone once said, "ThesNEWLINEs
three most difficult things for a human being are not physical feats orsNEWLINEs
intellectual achievements. They are, first, returning love for hate;sNEWLINEs
second, including the excluded; third, admitting that you are wrong".sNEWLINEs
But these are the easiest things in the world if you haven't identifiedsNEWLINEs
with the "me". You can say things like "I 'm wrong! If you knew mesNEWLINEs
better, you'd see how often I'm wrong. What would you expect fromsNEWLINEs
an ass"?sNEWLINEs

But if I haven't identified with these aspects of "me", you can't hurtsNEWLINEs
me. Initially, the old conditioning will kick in and you'll be depressedsNEWLINEs
and anxious. You'll grieve, cry, and so on. "Before enlightenment, IsNEWLINEs
used to be depressed: after enlightenment, 1 continue to besNEWLINEs
depressed". But there's a difference: I don't identify with it anymore.sNEWLINEs
Do you know what a big difference that is? You step outside ofsNEWLINEs
yourself and look at that depression, and don't identify with it. YousNEWLINEs
don't do a thing to make it go away; you are perfectly willing to go onsNEWLINEs
with your life while it passes through you and disappears. If you don'tsNEWLINEs
know what that means, you really have something to look forward to.sNEWLINEs
And anxiety? There it comes and you're not troubled. How strange!sNEWLINEs
You're anxious but you're not troubled.sNEWLINEs

Isn't that a paradox? And you're willing to let this cloud come in,sNEWLINEs
because the more you fight it, the more power you give it. You'resNEWLINEs
willing to observe it as it passes by. You can be happy in yoursNEWLINEs
anxiety. Isn't that crazy? You can be happy in your depression. ButsNEWLINEs
you can't have the wrong notion of happiness. Did you thinksNEWLINEs





happiness was excitement or thrills? That's what causes thesNEWLINEs
depression. Didn't anyone tell you that? You're thrilled, all right, butsNEWLINEs
you're just preparing the way for your next depression. You're thrilledsNEWLINEs
but you pick up the anxiety behind that: How can I make it last?sNEWLINEs
That's not happiness, that's addiction.sNEWLINEs

I wonder how many non-addicts there are reading this book? IfsNEWLINEs
you're anything like the average group, there are few, very few.sNEWLINEs
Don't look down your nose at the alcoholics and the drug addicts:sNEWLINEs
maybe you're just as addicted as they are. The first time I got asNEWLINEs
glimpse of this new world, it was terrifying. I understood what itsNEWLINEs
meant to be alone, with nowhere to rest your head, to leavesNEWLINEs
everyone free and be free yourself, to be special to no one and lovesNEWLINEs
everyone- because love does that. It shines on good and bad alike; itsNEWLINEs
makes rain fall on saints and sinners alike.sNEWLINEs

Is it possible for the rose to say, "I will give my fragrance to the goodsNEWLINEs
people who smell me, but I will withhold it from the bad"? Or is itsNEWLINEs
possible for the lamp to say, "I will give my light to the good peoplesNEWLINEs
in this room, but I will withhold it from the evil people"? Or can a treesNEWLINEs
say, "I 'II give my shade to the good people who rest under me, but IsNEWLINEs
will withhold it from the bad"? These are images of what love issNEWLINEs
about.sNEWLINEs

It's been there all along, staring us in the face in the scriptures,sNEWLINEs
though we never cared to see it because we were so drowned in whatsNEWLINEs
our culture calls love with its love songs and poems -- that isn't lovesNEWLINEs
at all, that's the opposite of love. That's desire and control andsNEWLINEs
possessiveness. That's manipulation, and fear, and anxiety -- that'ssNEWLINEs
not love. We were told that happiness is a smooth complexion, asNEWLINEs
holiday resort. It isn't these things, but we have subtle ways ofsNEWLINEs
making our happiness depend on other things, both within us andsNEWLINEs
outside us.sNEWLINEs

We say, "I refuse to be happy until my neurosis goes". I have goodsNEWLINEs
news for you: You can be happy right now, WITH the neurosis. YousNEWLINEs
want even better news? There's only one reason why you're notsNEWLINEs
experiencing what in India we call ANAND -- bliss, bliss. There's onlysNEWLINEs
one reason why you're not experiencing bliss at this present moment,sNEWLINEs
and it's because you're thinking or focusing on what you don't have.sNEWLINEs
Otherwise you would be experiencing bliss. You're focusing on whatsNEWLINEs
you don't have. But, right now you have everything you need to be insNEWLINEs
bliss. Jesus was talking horse sense to lay people, to starving people,sNEWLINEs
to poor people. He was telling them good news: It's yours for thesNEWLINEs





taking. But who listens? No one's interested, tiiey'd rather be asleep.sNEWLINEs



FEAR - THE ROOT OF VIOLENCEsNEWLINEs

20sNEWLINEs

Some say that there are only two things in the world: God and Fear.sNEWLINEs
Love and Fear are the only two things. There's only one evil in thesNEWLINEs
world, Fear. There's only one good in the world. Love. It's sometimessNEWLINEs
called by other names. It's sometimes called happiness or freedom orsNEWLINEs
peace or joy or God or whatever. But the label doesn't really matter.sNEWLINEs
And there's not a single evil in the world that you cannot trace tosNEWLINEs
fear. Not one.sNEWLINEs

Ignorance and fear, ignorance caused by fear, that's where all thesNEWLINEs
evil comes from, that's where your violence comes from. The personsNEWLINEs
who is truly nonviolent, who is incapable of violence, is the personsNEWLINEs
who is fearless. It's only when you're afraid that you become angry.sNEWLINEs
Think of the last time you were angry. Go ahead. Think of the lastsNEWLINEs
time you were angry and search for the fear behind it.sNEWLINEs

What were you afraid of losing? What were you afraid would be takensNEWLINEs
from you? That's where the anger comes from. Think of an angrysNEWLINEs
person, maybe someone you're afraid of. Can you see how frightenedsNEWLINEs
he or she is? He's really frightened, he really is. She's reallysNEWLINEs
frightened or she wouldn't be angry. Ultimately, there are only twosNEWLINEs
things, love and fear.sNEWLINEs

In this retreat I'd rather leave it like this, unstructured and movingsNEWLINEs
from one thing to another and returning to themes again and again,sNEWLINEs
because that's the way to really grasp what I 'm saying. If it doesn'tsNEWLINEs
hit you the first time, it might the second time, and what doesn't hitsNEWLINEs
one person might hit another. I 've got different themes, but they aresNEWLINEs
all about the same thing. Call it awareness, call it love, call itsNEWLINEs
spirituality or freedom or awakening or whatever. It really is thesNEWLINEs
same thing.sNEWLINEs

AWARENESS AND CONTACT WITH REALITYsNEWLINEs

21sNEWLINEs

To watch everything inside of you and outside, and when there issNEWLINEs
something happening to you, to see it as if it were happening tosNEWLINEs
someone else, with no comment, no judgment, no attitude, nosNEWLINEs
interference, no attempt to change, only to understand. As you dosNEWLINEs
this, you'll begin to realize that increasingly you are disidentifyingsNEWLINEs
from "me".sNEWLINEs

St. Teresa of Avila says that toward the end of her life God gave hersNEWLINEs
an extraordinary grace. She doesn't use this modern expression, ofsNEWLINEs
course, but what it really boils down to is disidentifying from her self.sNEWLINEs
If someone else has cancer and I don't know the person, I 'm not allsNEWLINEs
that affected. If I had love and sensitivity, maybe I'd help, but I'msNEWLINEs
not emotionally affected. If YOU have an examination to take, I'm notsNEWLINEs
all that affected.sNEWLINEs

I can be quite philosophical about it and say, "Well, the more yousNEWLINEs
worry about it, the worse it'll get. Why not just take a good breaksNEWLINEs
instead of studying"? But when it's my turn to have an examination,sNEWLINEs
well, that's something else, isn't it? The reason is that I've identifiedsNEWLINEs
with "me" - with my family, my country, my possessions, my body,sNEWLINEs
me. How would it be if God gave me grace not to call these thingssNEWLINEs
mine? I 'd be detached; I 'd be disidentified. That's what it means tosNEWLINEs
lose the self, to deny the self, to die to self.sNEWLINEs







GOOD RELIGION -THE ANTITHESIS OF UNAWARENESSsNEWLINEs

22sNEWLINEs

Somebody came up to me once during a conference and asked,sNEWLINEs
"What about 'Our Lady of Fatima'"? What do you think of her? When IsNEWLINEs
am asked questions like that, I am reminded of the story of the timesNEWLINEs
they were taking the statue of Our Lady of Fatima on an airplane to asNEWLINEs
pilgrimage for worship, and as they were flying over the South ofsNEWLINEs
France the plane began to wobble and to shake and it looked like itsNEWLINEs
was going to come apart. And the miraculous statue cried out, "OursNEWLINEs
Lady of Lourdes, pray for us!" And all was well. Wasn't it wonderful,sNEWLINEs
one "Our Lady" helping another "Our Lady"?sNEWLINEs

There was also a group of a thousand people who went on asNEWLINEs
pilgrimage to Mexico City to venerate the shrine of Our Lady ofsNEWLINEs
Guadalupe and sat down before the statue in protest because thesNEWLINEs
Bishop of the Diocese had declared "Our Lady of Lourdes" patronesssNEWLINEs
of the diocese! They were sure that Our Lady of Guadalupe felt thissNEWLINEs
very much, so they were doing the protest in REPARATION for thesNEWLINEs
offense. That's the trouble with religion, if you don't watch out.sNEWLINEs

When I speak to Hindus, I tell them, "Your priests are not going to besNEWLINEs
happy to hear this" (notice how prudent I am this morning), "but GodsNEWLINEs
would be much happier, according to Jesus Christ, if you weresNEWLINEs
transformed than if you worshipped. He would be much more pleasedsNEWLINEs
by your loving than by your adoration". And when I talk to Moslems, IsNEWLINEs
say, "Your Ayatollah and your mullahs are not going to be happy tosNEWLINEs
hear this, but God is going to be much more pleased by your beingsNEWLINEs
transformed into a loving person than by saying, "Lord, Lord". It'ssNEWLINEs
infinitely more important that you be waking up. That's spirituality,sNEWLINEs
that's everything.sNEWLINEs

If you have that, you have God. Then you worship "in spirit and insNEWLINEs
truth". When you become love, when you are transformed into love.sNEWLINEs
The danger of what religion can do is very nicely brought out in asNEWLINEs
story told by Cardinal Martini, the Archbishop of Milan. The story hassNEWLINEs
to do with an Italian couple that's getting married. They have ansNEWLINEs
arrangement with the parish priest to have a little reception in thesNEWLINEs
parish courtyard outside the church. But it rained, and they couldn'tsNEWLINEs







have the reception, so they said to the priest, "Would it be all right ifsNEWLINEs
we had the celebration in the church"?sNEWLINEs

Now Father wasn't one bit happy about having a reception in thesNEWLINEs
church, but they said, "We will eat a little cake, sing a little song,sNEWLINEs
drink a little wine, and then go home". So Father was persuaded. ButsNEWLINEs
being good life-loving Italians they drank a little wine, sang a littlesNEWLINEs
song, then drank a little more wine, and sang some more songs, andsNEWLINEs
within a half hour there was a great celebration going on in thesNEWLINEs
church. And everybody was having a great time, lots of fun and frolic.sNEWLINEs
But Father was all tense, pacing up and down in the sacristy, allsNEWLINEs
upset about the noise they were making. The assistant pastor comessNEWLINEs
in and says, "I see you are quite tense".sNEWLINEs

"Of course, I 'm tense. Listen to all the noise they are making, and insNEWLINEs

the House of God!, for heaven's sake!"sNEWLINEs

"Well, Father, they really had no place to go".sNEWLINEs

"I know that! But do they have to make all that racket"?sNEWLINEs

"Well, we mustn't forget, must we. Father, that Jesus himself wassNEWLINEs

once present at a wedding!"sNEWLINEs

Father says, "I know Jesus Christ was present at a wedding banquet,sNEWLINEs

YOU don't have to tell me J esus Christ was present at a weddingsNEWLINEs

banquet! But they didn't have the Blessed Sacrament there!!!"sNEWLINEs

You know there are times like that when the Blessed SacramentsNEWLINEs
becomes more important than Jesus Christ. When worship becomessNEWLINEs
more important than love, when the Church becomes more importantsNEWLINEs
than life. When God becomes more important than the neighbor. AndsNEWLINEs
so it goes on. That's the danger. To my mind this is what J esus wassNEWLINEs
evidently calling us to -- first things first! The human being is muchsNEWLINEs
more important than the Sabbath.. Doing what I tell you, namely,sNEWLINEs
becoming what I am indicating to you, is much more important thansNEWLINEs
Lord, Lord. But your mullah is not going to be happy to hear that, IsNEWLINEs
assure you.sNEWLINEs

Your priests are not going to be happy to hear that. Not generally. SosNEWLINEs
that's what we have been talking about. Spirituality. Waking up. AndsNEWLINEs
as I told you, it is extremely important if you want to wake up to gosNEWLINEs
in for what I call "self observation". Be aware of what you're saying,sNEWLINEs
be aware of what you're doing, be aware of what you're thinking, besNEWLINEs
aware of how you're acting. Be aware of where you're coming from,sNEWLINEs
what your motives are. The unaware life is not worth living.sNEWLINEs

The unaware life is a mechanical life. It's not human, it'ssNEWLINEs





programmed, conditioned. We migint as well be a stone, a block ofsNEWLINEs
wood. In the country where I come from, you have hundreds ofsNEWLINEs
thousands of people living in little hovels, in extreme poverty, whosNEWLINEs
just manage to survive, working all day long, hard manual work,sNEWLINEs
sleep and then wake up in the morning, eat something, and start allsNEWLINEs
over again. And you sit back and think, "What a life". "Is that all thatsNEWLINEs
life holds in store for them"? And then you're suddenly jolted into thesNEWLINEs
realization that 99.999% of people here are not much better. You cansNEWLINEs
go to the movies, drive around in a car, you can go for a cruise. DosNEWLINEs
you think you are much better off than they are? You are just as deadsNEWLINEs
as they are. J ust as much a machine as they are - a slightly biggersNEWLINEs
one, but a machine nevertheless. That's sad. It's sad to think thatsNEWLINEs
people go through life like this.sNEWLINEs

People go through life with fixed ideas; they never change. They'resNEWLINEs
just not aware of what's going on. They might as well be a block ofsNEWLINEs
wood, or a rock, a talking, walking, thinking machine. That's notsNEWLINEs
human. They are puppets, jerked around by all kinds of things. PresssNEWLINEs
a button and you get a reaction. You can almost predict how thissNEWLINEs
person is going to react. If I study a person, I can tell you just howsNEWLINEs
he or she is going to react. With my therapy group, sometimes IsNEWLINEs
write on a piece of paper that so-and-so is going to start the sessionsNEWLINEs
and so-and-so will reply. Do you think that's bad? Well, don't listen tosNEWLINEs
people who say to you, "Forget yourself! Go out in love to others".sNEWLINEs
Don't listen to them! They're all wrong. The worst thing you can do issNEWLINEs
forget yourself when you go out to others in the so called helpingsNEWLINEs
attitude.sNEWLINEs

This was brought home to me very forcibly many years ago when IsNEWLINEs
did my studies in psychology in Chicago. We had a course insNEWLINEs
counseling for priests. It was open only to priests who were actuallysNEWLINEs
engaged in counseling and who agreed to bring a taped session tosNEWLINEs
class. There must have been about twenty of us. When it was mysNEWLINEs
turn, I brought a cassette with an interview I had had with a youngsNEWLINEs
woman. The instructor put it in a recorder and we all began to listensNEWLINEs
to it. After five minutes, as was his custom, the instructor stoppedsNEWLINEs
the tape and asked, "Any comments"? Someone said to me, "Why didsNEWLINEs
you ask her that question"? I said, "I'm not aware that I asked her asNEWLINEs
question.sNEWLINEs

As a matter of fact, I 'm quite sure I did not ask any questions". HesNEWLINEs
said, "You did". I was quite sure because at that time I wassNEWLINEs
consciously following the method of Carl Rogers, which is person-sNEWLINEs
oriented and non directive. You don't ask questions and you don'tsNEWLINEs





interrupt or give advice. So I was very aware that I mustn't asl&lt;sNEWLINEs
questions. Anyway, there was a dispute between us, so the instructorsNEWLINEs
said, "Why don't we play the tape again"? So we played it again andsNEWLINEs
there, to my horror, was a whopping big question, as tall as thesNEWLINEs
Empire State Building, a huge question. The interesting thing to mesNEWLINEs
was that I had heard that question three times, the first time,sNEWLINEs
presumably, when I asked it, the second time when I listened to thesNEWLINEs
tape in my room (because I wanted to take a good tape to class),sNEWLINEs
and the third time when I heard it in the classroom. But it hadn'tsNEWLINEs
registered! I wasn't aware.sNEWLINEs

That happens frequently in my therapy sessions or in my spiritualsNEWLINEs
direction. We tape-record the interview, and when the client listens tosNEWLINEs
it, he or she says, "You know, I didn't really hear what you saidsNEWLINEs
during the interview. I only heard what you said when I listened tosNEWLINEs
the tape". More interestingly, I didn't hear what I said during thesNEWLINEs
interview. It's shocking to discover that I 'm saying things in a therapysNEWLINEs
session that I 'm not aware of. The full import of them only dawns onsNEWLINEs
me later. Do you call that human? "Forget yourself and go out tosNEWLINEs
others", you say! Anyhow, after we listened to the whole tape theresNEWLINEs
in Chicago, the instructor said, "Are there any comments"? One of thesNEWLINEs
priests, a fifty year old man to whom I had taken a liking, said to me,sNEWLINEs
"Tony, I'd like to ask you a personal question. Would that be allsNEWLINEs
right"? I said, "Yes, go ahead. If I don't want to answer it, I won't".sNEWLINEs
He said, "Is this woman in the interview pretty"?sNEWLINEs

You know, honest to goodness, I was at a stage of my developmentsNEWLINEs
(or undevelopment) where I didn't notice if someone was good-sNEWLINEs
looking or not. It didn't matter to me. She was a sheep of Christ'ssNEWLINEs
flock; I was a pastor. I dispensed help. Isn't that great! It was thesNEWLINEs
way we were trained. So I said to him, "What's that got to do withsNEWLINEs
it"? He said, "Because you don't like her, do you"? I said, "What?!"sNEWLINEs

It hadn't ever struck me that I liked or disliked individuals. Like mostsNEWLINEs
people, I had an occasional dislike that would register insNEWLINEs
consciousness, but my attitude was mostly neutral. I asked, "WhatsNEWLINEs
makes you say that"? He said, "The tape". We went through the tapesNEWLINEs
again, and he said, "Listen to your voice. Notice how sweet it hassNEWLINEs
become. You're irritated, aren't you"? I was, and I was only becomingsNEWLINEs
aware of it right there. And what was I saying to her non-directively?sNEWLINEs
I was saying, "Don't come back". But I wasn't aware of that. MysNEWLINEs
priest friend said, "She's a woman. She will have picked this up.sNEWLINEs
When are you supposed to meet her next"? I said, "NextsNEWLINEs
Wednesday". He said, "My guess is she won't come back". She didn't.sNEWLINEs





I waited one week but she didn't come. I waited another weel&lt; andsNEWLINEs
she didn't come.sNEWLINEs

Then I called her. I broke one of my rules: Don't be the rescuer. IsNEWLINEs
called her and said to her, "Remember that tape you allowed me tosNEWLINEs
make for the class? It was a great help because the class pointed outsNEWLINEs
all kinds of things to me" (I didn't tell her what!) "that would makesNEWLINEs
the session somewhat more effective. So if you care to come back,sNEWLINEs
that would make it more effective". She said, "All right, I'll comesNEWLINEs
back". She did. The dislike was still there. It hadn't gone away, but itsNEWLINEs
wasn't getting in the way. What you are aware of you are in controlsNEWLINEs
of; what you are not aware of is in control of you. You are always asNEWLINEs
slave to what you're not aware of. When you're aware of it, you'resNEWLINEs
free from it. It's there, but you're not affected by it. You're notsNEWLINEs
controlled by it; you're not enslaved by it. That's the difference.sNEWLINEs

Awareness, awareness, awareness, awareness. What they trained ussNEWLINEs
to do in that course was to become participant observers. To put itsNEWLINEs
somewhat graphically, I 'd be talking to you and at the same time I 'dsNEWLINEs
be out there watching you and watching me. When I 'm listening tosNEWLINEs
you, it's infinitely more important for me to listen to me than to listensNEWLINEs
to you. Of course, it's important to listen to you, but it's moresNEWLINEs
important that I listen to me. Otherwise I won't be hearing you. Or I'llsNEWLINEs
be distorting everything you say. I'll be coming at you from my ownsNEWLINEs
conditioning. I 'II be reacting to you in all kinds of ways from mysNEWLINEs
insecurities, from my need to manipulate you, from my desire tosNEWLINEs
succeed, from irritations and feelings that I might not be aware of. SosNEWLINEs
it's frightfully important that I listen to me when I 'm listening to you.sNEWLINEs
That's what they were training us to do, obtaining awareness.sNEWLINEs

You don't always have to imagine yourself hovering somewhere in thesNEWLINEs
air. J ust to get a rough idea of what I 'm talking about, imagine asNEWLINEs
good driver, driving a car, who's concentrating on what you're saying.sNEWLINEs
In fact, he may even be having an argument with you, but he'ssNEWLINEs
perfectly aware of the road signals. The moment anything untowardsNEWLINEs
happens, the moment there's any sound, or noise, or bump, he'llsNEWLINEs
hear it at once. He'll say, "Are you sure you closed that door backsNEWLINEs
there"? How did he do that? He was aware, he was alert. The focus ofsNEWLINEs
his attention was on the conversation, or argument, but hissNEWLINEs
awareness was more diffused. He was taking in all kinds of things.sNEWLINEs

What I'm advocating here is not concentration. That's not important.sNEWLINEs
Many meditative techniques inculcate concentration, but I'm leery ofsNEWLINEs
that. They involve violence and frequently they involve furthersNEWLINEs





programming and conditioning. Winat I would advocate is awareness,sNEWLINEs
which is not the same as concentration at all. Concentration is asNEWLINEs
spotlight. You can be distracted from that, but when you're practicingsNEWLINEs
awareness, you're never distracted. Awareness is a floodlight. You'resNEWLINEs
open to anything that comes within the scope of your consciousness.sNEWLINEs
When awareness is turned on, there's never any distraction, becausesNEWLINEs
you're always aware of whatever happens to be.sNEWLINEs

Say I 'm looking at those trees and I 'm worrying. Am I distracted? IsNEWLINEs
am distracted only if I mean to concentrate on the trees. But if I'msNEWLINEs
aware that I 'm worried, too, that isn't a distraction at all. J ust besNEWLINEs
aware of where your attention goes. When anything goes awry orsNEWLINEs
anything untoward happens, you'll be alerted at once. Something'ssNEWLINEs
going wrong! The moment any negative feeling comes intosNEWLINEs
consciousness, you'll be alerted. You're like the driver of the car.sNEWLINEs

I told you that St. Teresa of Avila said God gave her the grace ofsNEWLINEs
disidentifying herself with herself. You hear children talk that way. AsNEWLINEs
two-year-old says, "Tommy had his breakfast this morning". HesNEWLINEs
doesn't say "I ", although he is Tommy. He says "Tommy" - in thesNEWLINEs
third person. Mystics feel that way. They have disidentified fromsNEWLINEs
themselves and they are at peace. This was the grace St. Teresa wassNEWLINEs
talking about. This is the "I " that the mystic masters of the East aresNEWLINEs
constantly urging people to discover. And those of the West, too! AndsNEWLINEs
you can count Meister Eckhart among them. They are urging peoplesNEWLINEs
to discover the "I "..sNEWLINEs



LABELSsNEWLINEs
23sNEWLINEs

The important thing is not to know who "I " is or what "I " is. You'llsNEWLINEs
never succeed. There are no words for it. The important thing is tosNEWLINEs
drop the labels. As the Japanese Zen masters say, "Don't seek thesNEWLINEs
truth; just drop your opinions". Drop your theories; don't seek thesNEWLINEs
truth. Truth isn't something you search for. If you stop beingsNEWLINEs
opinionated, you would know. Something similar happens here. If yousNEWLINEs
dropped your labels, you would know. What do I mean by labels?sNEWLINEs
Every label you can conceive of except perhaps that of human being.sNEWLINEs

I am a human being. Fair enough; doesn't say very much. But whensNEWLINEs
you say, "I am successful", that's crazy. Success is not part of thesNEWLINEs





"I". Success is something tinat comes and goes; it could be ineresNEWLINEs
today and gone tomorrow. Tiiat's not "I". When you said, "I was asNEWLINEs
success", you were in error; you were plunged into darkness. YousNEWLINEs
identified yourself with success. The same thing when you said, "I amsNEWLINEs
a failure, a lawyer, a businessman". You know what's going tosNEWLINEs
happen to you if you identify yourself with these things.sNEWLINEs

You're going to cling to them, you're going to be worried that theysNEWLINEs
may fall apart, and that's where your suffering comes in. That is whatsNEWLINEs
I meant earlier when I said to you, "If you're suffering, you'resNEWLINEs
asleep". Do you want a sign that you're asleep? Here it is: You'resNEWLINEs
suffering. Suffering is a sign that you're out of touch with the truth.sNEWLINEs

Suffering is given to you that you might open your eyes to the truth,sNEWLINEs
that you might understand that there's falsehood somewhere, just assNEWLINEs
physical pain is given to you so you will understand that there issNEWLINEs
disease or illness somewhere. Suffering points out that there issNEWLINEs
falsehood somewhere. Suffering occurs when you clash with reality.sNEWLINEs
When your illusions clash with reality, when your falsehoods clashsNEWLINEs
with truth, then you have suffering. Otherwise there is no suffering.sNEWLINEs



OBSTACLES TO HAPPINESSsNEWLINEs
24sNEWLINEs

What I'm about to say will sound a bit pompous, but it's true. What issNEWLINEs
coming could be the most important minutes in your lives. If yousNEWLINEs
could grasp this, you'd hit upon the secret of awakening. You wouldsNEWLINEs
be happy forever. You would never be unhappy again. Nothing wouldsNEWLINEs
have the power to hurt you again. I mean that, nothing. It's likesNEWLINEs
when you throw black paint in the air, the air remainssNEWLINEs
uncontaminated. You never color the air black. No matter whatsNEWLINEs
happens to you, you remain uncontaminated. You remain at peace.sNEWLINEs
There are human beings who have attained this, what I call beingsNEWLINEs
human. Not this nonsense of being a puppet, jerked about this waysNEWLINEs
and that way, letting events or other people tell you how to feel. SosNEWLINEs
you proceed to feel it and you call it being vulnerable. Ha! I call itsNEWLINEs
being a puppet. So you want to be a puppet? Press a button andsNEWLINEs
you're down; do you like that? But if you refuse to identify with anysNEWLINEs
of those labels, most of your worries cease.sNEWLINEs







Later we'll talk about fear of disease and death, but ordinarily you'resNEWLINEs
worried about what's going to happen to your career. A small-timesNEWLINEs
businessman, fifty-five years old, is sipping beer at a bar somewheresNEWLINEs
and he's saying, "Well, look at my classmates, they've really madesNEWLINEs
it". The idiot! What does he mean, "They made it"? They've got theirsNEWLINEs
names in the newspaper. Do you call that making it? One is presidentsNEWLINEs
of the corporation; the other has become the Chief J ustice; somebodysNEWLINEs
else has become this or that. Monkeys, all of them.sNEWLINEs

Who determines what it means to be a success? This stupid society!sNEWLINEs
The main preoccupation of society is to keep society sick! And thesNEWLINEs
sooner you realize that, the better. Sick, every one of them. They aresNEWLINEs
loony, they're crazy. You became president of the lunatic asylum andsNEWLINEs
you're proud of it even though it means nothing. Being president of asNEWLINEs
corporation has nothing to do with being a success in life. Having asNEWLINEs
lot of money has nothing to do with being a success in life. You're asNEWLINEs
success in life when you wake up! Then you don't have to apologizesNEWLINEs
to anyone, you don't have to explain anything to anyone, you don'tsNEWLINEs
give a damn what anybody thinks about you or what anybody sayssNEWLINEs
about you. You have no worries; you're happy. That's what I callsNEWLINEs
being a success.sNEWLINEs

Having a good job or being famous or having a great reputation hassNEWLINEs
absolutely nothing to do with happiness or success. Nothing! It issNEWLINEs
totally irrelevant. All he's really worried about is what his children willsNEWLINEs
think about him, what the neighbors will think about him, what hissNEWLINEs
wife will think about him. He should have become famous. OursNEWLINEs
society and culture drill that into our heads day and night. PeoplesNEWLINEs
who made it! Made what?! Made asses of themselves. Because theysNEWLINEs
drained all their energy getting something that was worthless.sNEWLINEs
They're frightened and confused, they are puppets like the rest. LooksNEWLINEs
at them strutting across the stage. Look how upset they get if theysNEWLINEs
have a stain on their shirt. Do you call that a success?sNEWLINEs

Look at how frightened they are at the prospect they might not besNEWLINEs
reelected. Do you call that a success? They are controlled, sosNEWLINEs
manipulated. They are unhappy people, they are miserable people.sNEWLINEs
They don't enjoy life. They are constantly tense and anxious. Do yousNEWLINEs
call that human? And do you know why that happens? Only onesNEWLINEs
reason: They identified with some label. They identified the "I" withsNEWLINEs
their money or their job or their profession. That was their error.sNEWLINEs

Did you hear about the lawyer who was presented with a plumber'ssNEWLINEs
bill? He said to the plumber, "Hey, you're charging me two hundredsNEWLINEs





dollars an hour. I don't make that kind of money as a lawyer". ThesNEWLINEs
plumber said, "I didn't make that kind of money when I was a lawyersNEWLINEs
either!" You could be a plumber or a lawyer or a business man or asNEWLINEs
priest, but that does not affect the essential "I ". It doesn't affect you.sNEWLINEs
If I change my profession tomorrow, it's just like changing mysNEWLINEs
clothes. I am untouched. Are you your clothes? Are you your name?sNEWLINEs
Are you your profession? Stop identifying with them. They come andsNEWLINEs
go.sNEWLINEs

When you really understand this, no criticism can affect you. NosNEWLINEs
flattery or praise can affect you either. When someone says, "You'resNEWLINEs
a great guy", what is he talking about? He's talking about "me", he'ssNEWLINEs
not talking about "I ". "I " is neither great nor small. "I " is neithersNEWLINEs
successful nor a failure. It is none of these labels. These things comesNEWLINEs
and go. These things depend on the criteria society establishes.sNEWLINEs
These things depend on your conditioning. These things depend onsNEWLINEs
the mood of the person who happens to be talking to you right now.sNEWLINEs
It has nothing to do with "I". "I" is none of these labels. "Me" issNEWLINEs
generally selfish, foolish, childish - a great big ass. So when you say,sNEWLINEs
"You're an ass", I've known it for years! The conditioned self - whatsNEWLINEs
did you expect? I've known it for years. Why do you identify withsNEWLINEs
him? Silly! That isn't "I", that's "me".sNEWLINEs

Do you want to be happy? Uninterrupted happiness is uncaused. TruesNEWLINEs
happiness is uncaused. You cannot make me happy. You are not mysNEWLINEs
happiness. You say to the awakened person, "Why are you happy"?sNEWLINEs
and the awakened person replies, "Why not"? Happiness is oursNEWLINEs
natural state. Happiness is the natural state of little children, tosNEWLINEs
whom the kingdom belongs until they have been polluted andsNEWLINEs
contaminated by the stupidity of society and culture. To acquiresNEWLINEs
happiness you don't have to do anything, because happiness cannotsNEWLINEs
be acquired. Does anybody know why?sNEWLINEs

Because we have it already. How can you acquire what you alreadysNEWLINEs
have? Then why don't you experience it? Because you've got to dropsNEWLINEs
something. You've got to drop illusions. You don't have to addsNEWLINEs
anything in order to be happy; you've got to drop something. Life issNEWLINEs
easy, life is delightful. It's only hard on your illusions, your ambitions,sNEWLINEs
your greed, your cravings. Do you know where these things comesNEWLINEs
from? From having identified with all kinds of labels!sNEWLINEs







FOUR STEPS TO WISDOMsNEWLINEs
25sNEWLINEs

The first thing you need to do is get in touch with negative feelingssNEWLINEs
that you're not even aware of. Lots of people have negative feelingssNEWLINEs
they're not aware of. Lots of people are depressed and they're notsNEWLINEs
aware they are depressed. It's only when they make contact with joysNEWLINEs
that they understand how depressed they were. You can't deal with asNEWLINEs
cancer that you haven't detected. You can't get rid of boll weevils onsNEWLINEs
your farm if you're not aware of their existence. The first thing yousNEWLINEs
need is awareness of your negative feelings. What negative feelings?sNEWLINEs
Gloominess, for instance. You're feeling gloomy and moody. You feelsNEWLINEs
self-hatred or guilt. You feel that life is pointless, that it makes nosNEWLINEs
sense; you've got hurt feelings, you're feeling nervous and tense. GetsNEWLINEs
in touch with those feelings first.sNEWLINEs

The second step (this is a four-step program) is to understand thatsNEWLINEs
the feeling is in you, not in reality. That's such a self-evident thing,sNEWLINEs
but do you think people know it? They don't, believe me. They've gotsNEWLINEs
Ph.D.s and are presidents of universities, but they haven't understoodsNEWLINEs
this. They didn't teach me how to live at school. They taught mesNEWLINEs
everything else. As one man said, "I got a pretty good education. ItsNEWLINEs
took me years to get over it". That's what spirituality is all about, yousNEWLINEs
know: unlearning. Unlearning all the rubbish they taught you.sNEWLINEs

Negative feelings are in you, not in reality. So stop trying to changesNEWLINEs
reality. That's crazy! Stop trying to change the other person. WesNEWLINEs
spend all our time and energy trying to change externalsNEWLINEs
circumstances, trying to change our spouses, our bosses, our friends,sNEWLINEs
our enemies, and everybody else. We don't have to change anything.sNEWLINEs
Negative feelings are in you. No person on earth has the power tosNEWLINEs
make you unhappy. There is no event on earth that has the power tosNEWLINEs
disturb you or hurt you. No event, condition, situation, or person.sNEWLINEs
Nobody told you this; they told you the opposite. That's why you're insNEWLINEs
the mess that you're in right now. That is why you're asleep. TheysNEWLINEs
never told you this. But it's self-evident.sNEWLINEs

Let's suppose that rain washes out a picnic. Who is feeling negative?sNEWLINEs
The rain? Or YOU? What's causing the negative feeling? The rain orsNEWLINEs
your reaction? When you bump your knee against a table, the table'ssNEWLINEs
fine. It's busy being what it was made to Be - a table. The pain is insNEWLINEs
your knee, not in the table. The mystics keep trying to tell us thatsNEWLINEs
reality is all right. Reality is not problematic. Problems exist only insNEWLINEs





the human mind. We might add: in the stupid, sleeping human mind.sNEWLINEs
Reality is not problematic. Take away human beings from this planetsNEWLINEs
and life would go on, nature would go on in all its loveliness andsNEWLINEs
violence. Where would the problem be? No problem. You created thesNEWLINEs
problem. You are the problem. You identified with "me" and that issNEWLINEs
the problem. The feeling is in you, not in reality.sNEWLINEs

The third step: Never identify with that feeling. It has nothing to dosNEWLINEs
with the "I ". Don't define your essential self in terms of that feeling.sNEWLINEs
Don't say, "I am depressed". If you want to say, "It is depressed",sNEWLINEs
that's all right. If you want to say depression is there, that's fine; ifsNEWLINEs
you want to say gloominess is there, that's fine. But not: I amsNEWLINEs
gloomy. You're defining yourself in terms of the feeling. That's yoursNEWLINEs
illusion; that's your mistake. There is a depression there right now,sNEWLINEs
there are hurt feelings there right now, but let it be, leave it alone. ItsNEWLINEs
will pass. Everything passes, everything. Your depressions and yoursNEWLINEs
thrills have nothing to do with happiness. Those are the swings of thesNEWLINEs
pendulum. If you seek kicks or thrills, get ready for depression. DosNEWLINEs
you want your drug? Get ready for the hangover. One end of thesNEWLINEs
pendulum swings to the other.sNEWLINEs

This has nothing to do with "I"; it has nothing to do with happiness.sNEWLINEs
It is the "me". If you remember this, if you say it to yourself asNEWLINEs
thousand times, if you try these three steps a thousand times, yousNEWLINEs
will get it. You might not need to do it even three times. I don'tsNEWLINEs
know; there's no rule for it. But do it a thousand times and you'llsNEWLINEs
make the biggest discovery in your life. To hell with those gold minessNEWLINEs
in Alaska. What are you going to do with that gold? If you're notsNEWLINEs
happy, you can't live. So you found gold. What does that matter?sNEWLINEs
You're a king; you're a princess. You're free; you don't care anymoresNEWLINEs
about being accepted or rejected, that makes no difference.sNEWLINEs
Psychologists tell us how important it is to get a sense of belonging.sNEWLINEs
Baloney! Why do you want to belong to anybody? It doesn't mattersNEWLINEs
anymore.sNEWLINEs

A friend of mine told me that there's an African tribe where capitalsNEWLINEs
punishment consists of being ostracized. If you were kicked out ofsNEWLINEs
New York, or wherever you're residing, you wouldn't die. How is itsNEWLINEs
that the African tribesman died? Because he partakes of the commonsNEWLINEs
stupidity of humanity. He thinks he will not be able to live if he doessNEWLINEs
not belong. It's very different from most people, or is it? He'ssNEWLINEs
convinced he needs to belong. But you don't need to belong tosNEWLINEs
anybody or anything or any group. You don't even need to be in love.sNEWLINEs
Who told you you do? What you need is to be free. What you need issNEWLINEs





to love. That's it; that's your nature. But what you're really telling mesNEWLINEs
is that you want to be desired. You want to be applauded, to besNEWLINEs
attractive, to have all the little monkeys running after you. You'resNEWLINEs
wasting your life. WAKE UP! You don't need this. You can be blissfullysNEWLINEs
happy without it.sNEWLINEs

Your society is not going to be happy to hear this, because yousNEWLINEs
become terrifying when you open your eyes and understand this.sNEWLINEs
How do you control a person like this? He doesn't need you; he's notsNEWLINEs
threatened by your criticism; he doesn't care what you think of himsNEWLINEs
or what you say about him. He's cut all those strings; he's not asNEWLINEs
puppet any longer. It's terrifying. "So we've got to get rid of him. HesNEWLINEs
tells the truth; he has become fearless; he has stopped beingsNEWLINEs
human." HUMAN! Behold! A human being at last! He broke out of hissNEWLINEs
slavery, broke out of their prison.sNEWLINEs

No event justifies a negative feeling. There is no situation in thesNEWLINEs
world that justifies a negative feeling. That's what all our mysticssNEWLINEs
have been crying themselves hoarse to tell us. But nobody listens.sNEWLINEs
The negative feeling is in you. In the Bhagavad-Gita, the sacred booksNEWLINEs
of the Hindus, Lord Krishna says to Arjuna, "Plunge into the heat ofsNEWLINEs
battle and keep your heart at the lotus feet of the Lord". A marveloussNEWLINEs
sentence.sNEWLINEs

You don't have to do anything to acquire happiness. The greatsNEWLINEs
Meister Eckhart said very beautifully, "God is not attained by asNEWLINEs
process of addition to anything in the soul, but by a process ofsNEWLINEs
subtraction". You don't do anything to be free, you drop something.sNEWLINEs
Then you're free. 1 1 reminds me of the I rish prisoner who dug asNEWLINEs
tunnel under the prison wall and managed to escape. He comes outsNEWLINEs
right in the middle of a school playground where little children aresNEWLINEs
playing. Of course, when he emerges from the tunnel he can'tsNEWLINEs
restrain himself anymore and begins to jump up and down, crying,sNEWLINEs
"I'm free, I'm free, I'm free! A little girl there looks at him scornfullysNEWLINEs
and says, "That's nothing. I'm four".sNEWLINEs

The fourth step: How do you change things? How do you changesNEWLINEs
yourselves? There are many things you must understand here, orsNEWLINEs
rather, just one thing that can be expressed in many ways. Imagine asNEWLINEs
patient who goes to a doctor and tells him what he is suffering from.sNEWLINEs
The doctor says, "Very well, I've understood your symptoms. Do yousNEWLINEs
know what I will do? I will prescribe a medicine for your neighbor!"sNEWLINEs
The patient replies, "Thank you very much. Doctor, that makes mesNEWLINEs
feel much better". Isn't that absurd? But that's what we all do. ThesNEWLINEs





person who is asleep always thinks he'll feel better if somebody elsesNEWLINEs
changes. You're suffering because you are asleep, but you'resNEWLINEs
thinking, "How wonderful life would be if somebody else wouldsNEWLINEs
change; how wonderful life would be if my neighbor changed, my wifesNEWLINEs
changed, my boss changed".sNEWLINEs

We always want someone else to change so that we will feel good.sNEWLINEs
But has it ever struck you that even if your wife changes or yoursNEWLINEs
husband changes, what does that do to you? You're just assNEWLINEs
vulnerable as before; you're just as idiotic as before; you're just assNEWLINEs
asleep as before. You are the one who needs to change, who needssNEWLINEs
to take medicine. You keep insisting, "I feel good because the worldsNEWLINEs
is right". Wrong! The world is right because I feel good. That's whatsNEWLINEs
all the mystics are saying.sNEWLINEs



ALL'S RIGHT WITH THE WORLDsNEWLINEs

26sNEWLINEs

When you awaken, when you understand, when you see, the worldsNEWLINEs
becomes right. We're always bothered by the problem of evil. There'ssNEWLINEs
a powerful story about a little boy walking along the bank of a river.sNEWLINEs
He sees a crocodile who is trapped in a net. The crocodile says,sNEWLINEs
"Would you have pity on me and release me? I may look ugly, but itsNEWLINEs
isn't my fault, you know. I was made this way. But whatever mysNEWLINEs
external appearance, I have a mother's heart. I came this morning insNEWLINEs
search of food for my young ones and got caught in this trap!" So thesNEWLINEs
boy says, "Ah, if I were to help you out of that trap, you'd grab mesNEWLINEs
and kill me".sNEWLINEs

The crocodile asks, "Do you think I would do that to my benefactorsNEWLINEs
and liberator"? So the boy is persuaded to take the net off and thesNEWLINEs
crocodile grabs him. As he is being forced between the jaws of thesNEWLINEs
crocodile, he says, "So this is what I get for my good actions". AndsNEWLINEs
the crocodile says, "Well, don't take it personally, son, this is the waysNEWLINEs
the world is, this is the law of life". The boy disputes this, so thesNEWLINEs
crocodile says, "Do you want to ask someone if it isn't so"? The boysNEWLINEs
sees a bird sitting on a branch and says, "Bird, is what the crocodilesNEWLINEs
says right"? The bird says, "The crocodile is right. Look at me. I wassNEWLINEs
coming home one day with food for my fledglings.sNEWLINEs

Imagine my horror to see a snake crawling up the tree, makingsNEWLINEs





Straight for my nest. I was totally helpless. It kept devouring mysNEWLINEs
young ones, one after the other. I kept screaming and shouting, butsNEWLINEs
it was useless. The crocodile is right, this is the law of life, this is thesNEWLINEs
way the world is". "See", says the crocodile. But the boy says, "LetsNEWLINEs
me ask someone else". So the crocodile says, "Well, all right, gosNEWLINEs
ahead". There was an old donkey passing by on the bank of the river.sNEWLINEs
"Donkey", says the boy, "this is what the crocodile says. Is thesNEWLINEs
crocodile right"? The donkey says, "The crocodile is quite right. LooksNEWLINEs
at me. I've worked and slaved for my master all my life and he barelysNEWLINEs
gave me enough to eat.sNEWLINEs

Now that I'm old and useless, he has turned me loose, and here I amsNEWLINEs
wandering in the jungle, waiting for some wild beast to pounce on mesNEWLINEs
and put an end to my life. The crocodile is right, this is the law of life,sNEWLINEs
this is the way the world is". "See", says the crocodile. "Let's go!" ThesNEWLINEs
boy says, "Give me one more chance, one last chance. Let me asksNEWLINEs
one other being. Remember how good I was to you"? So the crocodilesNEWLINEs
says, "All right, your last chance". The boy sees a rabbit passing by,sNEWLINEs
and he says, "Rabbit, is the crocodile right"? The rabbit sits on hissNEWLINEs
haunches and says to the crocodile, "Did you say that to that boy?sNEWLINEs

The crocodile says, "Yes, I did". "Wait a minute", says the rabbit.sNEWLINEs
"We've got to discuss this". "Yes", says the crocodile. But the rabbitsNEWLINEs
says, "How can we discuss it when you've got that boy in yoursNEWLINEs
mouth? Release him; he's got to take part in the discussion, too". ThesNEWLINEs
crocodile says, "You're a clever one, you are. The moment I releasesNEWLINEs
him, he'll run away". The rabbit says, "I thought you had more sensesNEWLINEs
than that. If he attempted to run away, one slash of your tail wouldsNEWLINEs
kill him". "Fair enough", says the crocodile, and he released the boy.sNEWLINEs
The moment the boy is released, the rabbit says, "Run!" And the boysNEWLINEs
runs and escapes. Then the rabbit says to the boy, "Don't you enjoysNEWLINEs
crocodile flesh?sNEWLINEs

Wouldn't the people in your village like a good meal? You didn't reallysNEWLINEs
release that crocodile; most of his body is still caught in that net.sNEWLINEs
Why don't you go to the village and bring everybody and have asNEWLINEs
banquet". That's exactly what the boy does. He goes to the villagesNEWLINEs
and calls all the men folk. They come with their axes and staves andsNEWLINEs
spears and kill the crocodile. The boy's dog comes, too, and when thesNEWLINEs
dog sees the rabbit, he gives chase, catches hold of the rabbit, andsNEWLINEs
throttles him. The boy comes on the scene too late, and as hesNEWLINEs
watches the rabbit die, he says, "The crocodile was right, this is thesNEWLINEs
way the world is, this is the law of life".sNEWLINEs







There is no explanation you can give tiiat would explain away all thesNEWLINEs
sufferings and evil and torture and destruction and hunger in thesNEWLINEs
world! You'll never explain it. You can try gamely with your formulas,sNEWLINEs
religious and otherwise, but you'll never explain it. Because life is asNEWLINEs
mystery, which means your thinking mind cannot make sense out ofsNEWLINEs
it. For that you've got to wake up and then you'll suddenly realizesNEWLINEs
that reality is not problematic, you are the problem.sNEWLINEs



SLEEPWALKINGsNEWLINEs
27sNEWLINEs

The scriptures are always hinting of that, but you'll never understandsNEWLINEs
a word of what the scriptures are saying until you wake up. SleepingsNEWLINEs
people read the scriptures and crucify the Messiah on the basis ofsNEWLINEs
them. You've got to wake up to make sense out of the scriptures.sNEWLINEs
When you do wake up, they make sense. So does reality. But you'llsNEWLINEs
never be able to put it into words. You'd rather do something? ButsNEWLINEs
even there we've got to make sure that you're not swinging intosNEWLINEs
action simply to get rid of your negative feelings. Many people swingsNEWLINEs
into action only to make things worse.sNEWLINEs

They're not coming from love, they're coming from negative feelings.sNEWLINEs
They're coming from guilt, anger, hate; from a sense of injustice orsNEWLINEs
whatever. You've got to make sure of your "being" before you swingsNEWLINEs
into action. You have to make sure of who you are before you act.sNEWLINEs
Unfortunately, when sleeping people swing into action, they simplysNEWLINEs
substitute one cruelty for another, one injustice for another. And so itsNEWLINEs
goes. Meister Eckhart says, "It is not by your actions that you will besNEWLINEs
saved" (or awakened; call it by any word you want), "but by yoursNEWLINEs
being. It is not by what you do, but by what you are that you will besNEWLINEs
judged". What good is it to you to feed the hungry, give the thirsty tosNEWLINEs
drink, or visit prisoners in jail?sNEWLINEs

Remember that sentence from Paul: "If I give my body to be burnedsNEWLINEs
and all my goods to feed the poor and have not love . . ". It's notsNEWLINEs
your actions, it's your being that counts. Then you might swing intosNEWLINEs
action. You might or might not. You can't decide that until you'resNEWLINEs
awake. Unfortunately, all the emphasis is concentrated on changingsNEWLINEs
the world and very little emphasis is given to waking up. When yousNEWLINEs
wake up, you will know what to do or what not to do. Some mysticssNEWLINEs







are very strange, you know. Like Jesus, who said something like "IsNEWLINEs
wasn't sent to those people; I limit myself to what I am supposed tosNEWLINEs
do right now. Later, maybe". Some mystics go silent. Mysteriously,sNEWLINEs
some of them sing songs. Some of them are into service. We're neversNEWLINEs
sure. They're a law unto themselves; they know exactly what is to besNEWLINEs
done. "Plunge into the heat of battle and keep your heart at the lotussNEWLINEs
feet of the Lord", as I said to you earlier.sNEWLINEs

Imagine that you're unwell and in a foul mood, and they're takingsNEWLINEs
you through some lovely countryside. The landscape is beautiful butsNEWLINEs
you're not in the mood to see anything. A few days later you pass thesNEWLINEs
same place and you say, "Good heavens, where was I that I didn'tsNEWLINEs
notice all of this"? Everything becomes beautiful when you change. OrsNEWLINEs
you look at the trees and the mountains through windows that aresNEWLINEs
wet with rain from a storm, and everything looks blurred andsNEWLINEs
shapeless. You want to go right out there and change those trees,sNEWLINEs
change those mountains. Wait a minute, let's examine your window.sNEWLINEs
When the storm ceases and the rain stops, and you look out thesNEWLINEs
window, you say, "Well, how different everything looks". We seesNEWLINEs
people and things not as they are, but as we are. That is why whensNEWLINEs
two people look at something or someone, you get two differentsNEWLINEs
reactions. We see things and people not as they are, but as we are.sNEWLINEs

Remember that sentence from scripture about everything turning intosNEWLINEs
good for those who love God? When you finally awake, you don't trysNEWLINEs
to make good things happen; they just happen. You understandsNEWLINEs
suddenly that everything that happens to you is good. Think of somesNEWLINEs
people you're living with whom you want to change. You find themsNEWLINEs
moody, inconsiderate, unreliable, treacherous, or whatever. But whensNEWLINEs
you are different, they'll be different. That's an infallible andsNEWLINEs
miraculous cure. The day you are different, they will becomesNEWLINEs
different. And you will see them differently, too.sNEWLINEs

Someone who seemed terrifying will now seem frightened. SomeonesNEWLINEs
who seemed rude will seem frightened. All of a sudden, no one hassNEWLINEs
the power to hurt you anymore. No one has the power to putsNEWLINEs
pressure on you. It's something like this: You leave a book on thesNEWLINEs
table and I pick it up and say, "You're pressing this book on me. IsNEWLINEs
have to pick it up or not pick it up". People are so busy accusingsNEWLINEs
everyone else, blaming everyone else, blaming life, blaming society,sNEWLINEs
blaming their neighbor. You'll never change that way; you'll continuesNEWLINEs
in your nightmare, you'll never wake up.sNEWLINEs

Put this program into action, a thousand times: (a) identify thesNEWLINEs







negative feelings in you; (b) understand that tiiey are in you, not insNEWLINEs
tine world, not in external reality; (c) do not see them as an essentialsNEWLINEs
part of "I"; these things come and go; (d) understand that when yousNEWLINEs
change, everything changes.sNEWLINEs



CHANGE AS GREEDsNEWLINEs
28sNEWLINEs

Do I do anything to change myself? I 've got a big surprise for you,sNEWLINEs
lots of good news! You don't have to do anything. The more you do,sNEWLINEs
the worse it gets. All you have to do is understand. Think ofsNEWLINEs
somebody you are living with or working with whom you do not like,sNEWLINEs
who causes negative feelings to arise in you. Let's help you tosNEWLINEs
understand what's going on. The first thing you need to understand issNEWLINEs
that the negative feeling is inside you. You are responsible for thesNEWLINEs
negative feeling, not the other person. Someone else in your placesNEWLINEs
would be perfectly calm and at ease in the presence of this person;sNEWLINEs
they wouldn't be affected. You are. Now, understand another thing,sNEWLINEs
that you're making a demand.sNEWLINEs

You have an expectation of this person. Can you get in touch withsNEWLINEs
that? Then say to this person, "I have no right to make any demandssNEWLINEs
on you". In saying that, you will drop your expectation. "I have nosNEWLINEs
right to make any demands on you. Oh, I 'II protect myself from thesNEWLINEs
consequences of your actions or your moods or whatever, but yousNEWLINEs
can go right ahead and be what you choose to be. I have no right tosNEWLINEs
make any demands on you".sNEWLINEs

See what happens to you when you do this. If there's a resistance tosNEWLINEs
saying it, my, how much you're going to discover about your "me".sNEWLINEs
Let the dictator in you come out, let the tyrant come out. You thoughtsNEWLINEs
you were such a little lamb, didn't you? But I 'm a tyrant and you're asNEWLINEs
tyrant. A little variation on "I'm an ass, you're an ass". I'm a dictator,sNEWLINEs
you're a dictator. I want to run your life for you; I want to tell yousNEWLINEs
exactly how you're expected to be and how you're expected tosNEWLINEs
behave, and you'd better behave as I have decided or I shall punishsNEWLINEs
myself by having negative feelings. Remember what I told you,sNEWLINEs
everybody's a lunatic.sNEWLINEs

A woman told me her son had gotten an award at his high school. ItsNEWLINEs
was for excellence in sports and academics. She was happy for him,sNEWLINEs





but was almost tempted to say to him, "Don't glory in that award,sNEWLINEs
because it's setting you up for the time when you can't perform assNEWLINEs
well". She was in a dilemma: how to prevent his futuresNEWLINEs
disillusionment without bursting his bubble now. Hopefully, he'll learnsNEWLINEs
as she herself grows in wisdom. It's not a matter of anything shesNEWLINEs
says to him. It's something that eventually she will become. Then shesNEWLINEs
will understand. Then she will know what to say and when to say it.sNEWLINEs
That award was a result of competition, which can be cruel if it issNEWLINEs
built on hatred of oneself and of others. People get a good feeling onsNEWLINEs
the basis of somebody getting a bad feeling; you win over somebodysNEWLINEs
else. Isn't that terrible? Taken for granted in a lunatic asylum!sNEWLINEs

There's an American doctor who wrote about the effect of competitionsNEWLINEs
on his life. He went to medical school in Switzerland and there was asNEWLINEs
fairly large contingent of Americans at that school. He said some ofsNEWLINEs
the students went into shock when they realized that there were nosNEWLINEs
grades, there were no awards, there was no dean's list, no first orsNEWLINEs
second in the class at the school. You either passed or you didn't. HesNEWLINEs
said, "Some of us just couldn't take it. We became almost paranoid.sNEWLINEs
We thought there must be some kind of trick here". So some of themsNEWLINEs
went to another school.sNEWLINEs

Those who survived suddenly discovered a strange thing they hadsNEWLINEs
never noticed at American universities: students, brilliant ones,sNEWLINEs
helping others to pass, sharing notes. His son goes to medical schoolsNEWLINEs
in the United States and he tells him that, in the lab, people oftensNEWLINEs
tamper with the microscope so that it'll take the next student three orsNEWLINEs
four minutes to readjust it. Competition. They have to succeed, theysNEWLINEs
have to be perfect. And he tells a lovely little story which he says issNEWLINEs
factual, but it could also serve as a beautiful parable.sNEWLINEs

There was a little town in America where people gathered in thesNEWLINEs
evening to make music. They had a saxophonist, a drummer, and asNEWLINEs
violinist, mostly old people. They got together for the company andsNEWLINEs
for the sheer joy of making music, though they didn't do it very well.sNEWLINEs
So they were enjoying themselves, having a great time, until one daysNEWLINEs
they decided to get a new conductor who had a lot of ambition andsNEWLINEs
drive. The new conductor told them, "Hey, folks, we have to have asNEWLINEs
concert, we have to prepare a concert for the town".sNEWLINEs

Then he gradually got rid of some people who didn't play too well,sNEWLINEs
hired a few professional musicians, got an orchestra into shape, andsNEWLINEs
they all got their names in the newspapers. Wasn't that wonderful?sNEWLINEs
So they decided to move to the big city and play there: But some ofsNEWLINEs





the old people had tears in their eyes. They said, "It was sosNEWLINEs
wonderful in the old days when we did things badly and enjoyedsNEWLINEs
them". So cruelty came into their lives, but nobody recognized it assNEWLINEs
cruelty. See how lunatic people have become!sNEWLINEs

Some of you ask me what I meant when I said, "You go ahead andsNEWLINEs
be yourself, that's all right, but I'll protect myself, I'll be myself". InsNEWLINEs
other words, I won't allow you to manipulate me. I 'II live my life; I 'IIsNEWLINEs
go my own way; I 'II keep myself free to think my thoughts, to followsNEWLINEs
my inclinations and tastes. And I'll say no to you. If I feel I don'tsNEWLINEs
want to be in your company, it won't be because of any negativesNEWLINEs
feelings you cause in me. Because you don't anymore. You don't havesNEWLINEs
any more power over me. I simply might prefer other people'ssNEWLINEs
company. So when you say to me, "How about a movie tonight"? I'llsNEWLINEs
say, "Sorry, I want to go with someone else; I enjoy his companysNEWLINEs
more than yours". And that's all right.sNEWLINEs

To say no to people - that's wonderful; that's part of waking up. PartsNEWLINEs
of waking up is that you live your life as you see fit. And understand:sNEWLINEs
That is not selfish. The selfish thing is to demand that someone elsesNEWLINEs
live their life as YOU see fit. That's selfish. It is not selfish to live yoursNEWLINEs
life as you see fit. The selfishness lies in demanding that someonesNEWLINEs
else live their life to suit your tastes, or your pride, or your profit, orsNEWLINEs
your pleasure. That is truly selfish. So I'll protect myself. I won't feelsNEWLINEs
obligated to be with you; I won't feel obligated to say yes to you. If IsNEWLINEs
find your company pleasant, then I'll enjoy it without clinging to it.sNEWLINEs
But I no longer avoid you because of any negative feelings you createsNEWLINEs
in me. You don't have that power anymore.sNEWLINEs

Awakening should be a surprise. When you don't expect something tosNEWLINEs
happen and it happens, you feel surprise. When Webster's wifesNEWLINEs
caught him kissing the maid, she told him she was very surprised.sNEWLINEs
Now, Webster was a stickler for using words accuratelysNEWLINEs
(understandably, since he wrote a dictionary), so he answered her,sNEWLINEs
"No, my dear, I am surprised. You are astonished!"sNEWLINEs

Some people make awakening a goal. They are determined to getsNEWLINEs
there; they say, "I refuse to be happy until I'm awakened". In thatsNEWLINEs
case, it's better to be the way you are, simply to be aware of the waysNEWLINEs
you are. Simple awareness is happiness compared with trying tosNEWLINEs
react all the time. People react so quickly because they are notsNEWLINEs
aware. You will come to understand that there are times when yousNEWLINEs
will inevitably react, even in awareness. But as awareness grows, yousNEWLINEs
react less and act more. It really doesn't matter.sNEWLINEs





There's a story of a disciple who told his guru that he was going to asNEWLINEs
far place to meditate and hopefully attain enlightenment. So he sentsNEWLINEs
the guru a note every six months to report the progress he wassNEWLINEs
making. The first report said, "Now I understand what it means tosNEWLINEs
lose the self". The guru tore up the note and threw it in thesNEWLINEs
wastepaper basket. After six months he got another report, whichsNEWLINEs
said, "Now I have attained sensitivity to all beings". He tore it up.sNEWLINEs
Then a third report said, "Now I understand the secret of the one andsNEWLINEs
the many". It too was torn up.sNEWLINEs

And so it went on for years, until finally no reports came in. After asNEWLINEs
time the guru became curious and one day there was a traveler goingsNEWLINEs
to that far place. The guru said, "Why don't you find what happenedsNEWLINEs
to that fellow". Finally, he got a note from his disciple. It said, "WhatsNEWLINEs
does it matter"? And when the guru read that, he said, "He made it!sNEWLINEs
He made it! He finally got it! He got it!" And there is the story about asNEWLINEs
soldier on the battlefield who would simply drop his rifle to thesNEWLINEs
ground, pick up a scrap of paper lying there, and look at it. Then hesNEWLINEs
would let it flutter from his hands to the ground. And then he'd movesNEWLINEs
somewhere else and do the same thing. So others said, "This man issNEWLINEs
exposing himself to death. He needs help". So they put him in thesNEWLINEs
hospital and got the best psychiatrist to work on him.sNEWLINEs

But it seemed to have no effect. He wandered around the wardssNEWLINEs
picking up scraps of paper, looking at them idly, and letting themsNEWLINEs
flutter to the ground. I n the end they said, "We've got to dischargesNEWLINEs
this man from the army". So they call him in and give him asNEWLINEs
discharge certificate and he idly picks it up, looks at it, and shouts,sNEWLINEs
"This is it? This is it". He finally got it. So begin to be aware of yoursNEWLINEs
present condition whatever that condition is. Stop being a dictator.sNEWLINEs
Stop trying to push yourself somewhere. Then someday you willsNEWLINEs
understand that simply by awareness you have already attained whatsNEWLINEs
you were pushing yourself toward.sNEWLINEs



A CHANGED PERSONsNEWLINEs
29sNEWLINEs

In your pursuit of awareness, don't make demands. It's more likesNEWLINEs
obeying the traffic rules. If you don't observe traffic rules, you paysNEWLINEs
the penalty. Here in the United States you drive on the right side ofsNEWLINEs





the road; in England you drive on tine left; in India you drive on thesNEWLINEs
left. If you don't, you pay the penalty; there is no room for hurtsNEWLINEs
feelings or demands or expectations; you just abide by the trafficsNEWLINEs
rules. You ask where compassion comes in, where guilt comes in allsNEWLINEs
this. You'll know when you're awake. If you're feeling guilty rightsNEWLINEs
now, how on earth can I explain it to you? How would you know whatsNEWLINEs
compassion is? You know, sometimes people want to imitate Christ,sNEWLINEs
but when a monkey plays a saxophone, that doesn't make him asNEWLINEs
musician. You can't imitate Christ by imitating his external behavior.sNEWLINEs
You've got to be Christ.sNEWLINEs

Then you'll know exactly what to do in a particular situation, givensNEWLINEs
your temperament, your character, and the character andsNEWLINEs
temperament of the person you're dealing with. No one has to tellsNEWLINEs
you. But to do that, you must be what Christ was. An externalsNEWLINEs
imitation will get you nowhere. If you think that compassion impliessNEWLINEs
softness, there's no way I can describe compassion to you, absolutelysNEWLINEs
no way, because compassion can be very hard. Compassion can besNEWLINEs
very rude, compassion can jolt you, compassion can roll up itssNEWLINEs
sleeves and operate on you. Compassion is all kinds of things.sNEWLINEs
Compassion can be very soft, but there's no way of knowing that. It'ssNEWLINEs
only when you become love - in other words, when you have droppedsNEWLINEs
your illusions and attachments - that you will "know".sNEWLINEs

As you identify less and less with the "me", you will be more at easesNEWLINEs
with everybody and with everything. Do you know why? Because yousNEWLINEs
are no longer afraid of being hurt or not liked. You no longer desire tosNEWLINEs
impress anyone. Can you imagine the relief when you don't have tosNEWLINEs
impress anybody anymore? Oh, what a relief. Happiness at last! YousNEWLINEs
no longer feel the need or the compulsion to explain things anymore.sNEWLINEs
It's all right. What is there to be explained? And you don't feel thesNEWLINEs
need or compulsion to apologize anymore.sNEWLINEs

I'd much rather hear you say, "I've come awake", than hear you say,sNEWLINEs
"I 'm sorry". I 'd much rather hear you say to me, "I 've come awakesNEWLINEs
since we last met; what I did to you won't happen again", than tosNEWLINEs
hear you say, "I 'm so sorry for what I did to you". Why would anyonesNEWLINEs
demand an apology? You have something to explore in that. EvensNEWLINEs
when someone supposedly was mean to you, there is no room forsNEWLINEs
apology. Nobody was mean to you. Somebody was mean to what hesNEWLINEs
or she thought was you, but not to you. Nobody ever rejects you;sNEWLINEs
they're only rejecting what they think you are. But that cuts bothsNEWLINEs
ways. Nobody ever accepts you either. Until people come awake, theysNEWLINEs
are simply accepting or rejecting their image of you.sNEWLINEs





They've fashioned an image of you, and they're rejecting or acceptingsNEWLINEs
that. See how devastating it is to go deeply into that. It's a bit toosNEWLINEs
liberating. But how easy it is to love people when you understandsNEWLINEs
this. How easy it is to love everyone when you don't identify withsNEWLINEs
what they imagine you are or they are. It becomes easy to lovesNEWLINEs
them, to love everybody. I observe "me", but I do not think aboutsNEWLINEs
"me". Because the thinking "me" does a lot of bad thinking, too. ButsNEWLINEs
when I watch "me", I am constantly aware that this is a reflection. InsNEWLINEs
reality, you don't really think of "I " and "me". You're like a personsNEWLINEs
driving the car; he doesn't ever want to lose consciousness of the car.sNEWLINEs

It's all right to daydream, but not to lose consciousness of yoursNEWLINEs
surroundings. You must always be alert. It's like a mother sleeping;sNEWLINEs
she doesn't hear the planes roaring above the house, but she hearssNEWLINEs
the slightest whimper of her baby. She's alert, she's awake in thatsNEWLINEs
sense. One can not say anything about the awakened state; one cansNEWLINEs
only talk about the sleeping state. One hints at the awakened state.sNEWLINEs
One cannot say anything about happiness. Happiness cannot besNEWLINEs
defined. What can be defined is misery. Drop unhappiness and yousNEWLINEs
will know. Love cannot be defined; unlove can. Drop unlove, dropsNEWLINEs
fear, and you will know. We want to find out what the awakenedsNEWLINEs
person is like. But you'll know only when you get there.sNEWLINEs

Am I implying, for example, that we shouldn't make demands on oursNEWLINEs
children? What I said was: "You don't have a right to make anysNEWLINEs
demands". Sooner or later that child is going to have to get rid ofsNEWLINEs
you, in keeping with the injunction of the Lord. And you're going tosNEWLINEs
have no rights over him at all. In fact, he really isn't your child andsNEWLINEs
he never was. He belongs to life, not to you. No one belongs to you.sNEWLINEs
What you're talking about is a child's education. If you want lunch,sNEWLINEs
you better come in between twelve and one or you don't get lunch.sNEWLINEs
Period. That's the way things are run here. You don't come on time,sNEWLINEs
you don't get your lunch. You're free, that true, but you must takesNEWLINEs
the consequences.sNEWLINEs

When I talk about not having expectations of others, or not makingsNEWLINEs
demands on them, I mean expectations and demands for my well-sNEWLINEs
being. The President of the United States obviously has to makesNEWLINEs
demands on people. The traffic policeman obviously has to makesNEWLINEs
demands on people. But these are demands on their behavior - trafficsNEWLINEs
laws, good organization, the smooth running of society. They are notsNEWLINEs
intended to make the President or traffic policeman feel good.sNEWLINEs









ARRIVING AT SILENCEsNEWLINEs
30sNEWLINEs

Everyone asks me about what will happen when they finally arrive. IssNEWLINEs
this just curiosity? We're always asking how would this fit into thatsNEWLINEs
systenn, or whether this would make sense in that context, or what itsNEWLINEs
will feel like when we get there, et started and you will know; itsNEWLINEs
cannot be described. It is said widely in the East, "Those who know,sNEWLINEs
do not say; those who say, do not know". It cannot be said; only thesNEWLINEs
opposite can be said.sNEWLINEs

The guru cannot give you the truth. Truth cannot be put into words,sNEWLINEs
into a formula. That isn't the truth. That isn't reality. Reality cannotsNEWLINEs
be put into a formula. The guru can only point out your errors. WhensNEWLINEs
you drop your errors, you will know the truth. And even then yousNEWLINEs
cannot say. This is common teaching among the great CatholicsNEWLINEs
mystics. The great Thomas Aquinas, toward the end of his life,sNEWLINEs
wouldn't write and wouldn't talk; he had seen. I had thought he keptsNEWLINEs
that famous silence of his for only a couple of months, but it went onsNEWLINEs
for years.sNEWLINEs

He realized he had made a fool of himself, and he said so explicitly.sNEWLINEs
It's as if you had never tasted a green mango and you ask me, "WhatsNEWLINEs
does it taste like"? I'd say to you, "Sour", but in giving you a word,sNEWLINEs
I 've put you off the track. Try to understand that. Most people aren'tsNEWLINEs
very wise; they seize upon the word - upon the words of scripture,sNEWLINEs
for example - and they get it all wrong. "Sour", I say, and you ask,sNEWLINEs
"Sour like vinegar, sour like a lemon"?sNEWLINEs

No, not sour like a lemon, but sour like a mango. "But I never tastedsNEWLINEs
one", you say. Too bad! But you go ahead and write a doctoral thesissNEWLINEs
on it. You wouldn't have if you had tasted it. You really wouldn't.sNEWLINEs
You'd have written a doctoral thesis on other things, but not onsNEWLINEs
mangoes. And the day you finally taste a green mango, you say,sNEWLINEs
"God, I made a fool of myself. I shouldn't have written that thesis".sNEWLINEs
That's exactly what Thomas Aquinas did.sNEWLINEs

A great German philosopher and theologian wrote a whole booksNEWLINEs
specifically on the silence of St. Thomas. He simply went silent.sNEWLINEs
Wouldn't talk. In the prologue of his Summa Theologica, which wassNEWLINEs
the summary of all his theology, he says, "About God, we cannot saysNEWLINEs





what He is but rather what He is not. And so we cannot speal&lt; aboutsNEWLINEs
how He is but rather how He is not". And in his famous commentarysNEWLINEs
on Boethius' De Sancta Trinitate he says there are three ways ofsNEWLINEs
l&lt;nowing God (1) in the creation, (2) in God's actions through history,sNEWLINEs
and (3) in the highest form of the l&lt;nowledge of God - to l&lt;now GodsNEWLINEs
tamquam ignotum (to l&lt;now God as the unl&lt;nown).sNEWLINEs

The highest form of tall&lt;ing about the Trinity is to l&lt;now that one doessNEWLINEs
not l&lt;now. Now, this is not an Oriental Zen master speal&lt;ing. This is asNEWLINEs
canonized saint of the Roman Catholic Church, the prince ofsNEWLINEs
theologians for centuries. To know God as unknown. In another placesNEWLINEs
St. Thomas even says as unknowable. Reality, God, divinity, truth,sNEWLINEs
love are unknowable; that means they cannot be comprehended bysNEWLINEs
the thinking mind. That would set at rest so many questions peoplesNEWLINEs
have because we're always living under the illusion that we know. WesNEWLINEs
don't. We cannot know.sNEWLINEs

What is scripture, then? It's a hint, a clue, not a description. ThesNEWLINEs
fanaticism of one sincere believer who thinks he knows causes moresNEWLINEs
evil than the united efforts of two hundred rogues. It's terrifying tosNEWLINEs
see what sincere believers will do because they think they know.sNEWLINEs
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we had a world where everybody said,sNEWLINEs
"We don't know"? One big barrier dropped. Wouldn't that besNEWLINEs
marvelous?sNEWLINEs

A man born blind comes to me and asks, "What is this thing calledsNEWLINEs
green"? How does one describe the color green to someone who wassNEWLINEs
born blind? One uses analogies. So I say, "The color green issNEWLINEs
something like soft music". "Oh", he says, "like soft music". "Yes", IsNEWLINEs
say, "soothing and soft music". So a second blind man comes to mesNEWLINEs
and asks, "What is the color green"? I tell him it's something like softsNEWLINEs
satin, very soft and soothing to the touch. So the next day I noticesNEWLINEs
that the two blind men are bashing each other over the head withsNEWLINEs
bottles.sNEWLINEs

One is saying, "It's soft like music"; the other is saying, "It's soft likesNEWLINEs
satin". And on it goes. Neither of them knows what they're talkingsNEWLINEs
about, because if they did, they'd shut up. It's as bad as that. It'ssNEWLINEs
even worse, because one day, say, you give sight to this blind man,sNEWLINEs
and he's sitting there in the garden and he's looking all around him,sNEWLINEs
and you say to him, "Well, now you know what the color green is".sNEWLINEs
And he answers, "That's true. I heard some of it this morning!"sNEWLINEs

The fact is that you're surrounded by God and you don't see God,sNEWLINEs





because you "know" about God. The final barrier to the vision of GodsNEWLINEs
is your God concept. You miss God because you thinl&lt; you l&lt;now.sNEWLINEs
That's the terrible thing about religion. That's what the gospels weresNEWLINEs
saying, that religious people "knew", so they got rid of Jesus. ThesNEWLINEs
highest knowledge of God is to know God as unknowable. There is farsNEWLINEs
too much God talk; the world is sick of it.sNEWLINEs

There is too little awareness, too little love, too little happiness, butsNEWLINEs
let's not use those words either. There's too little dropping ofsNEWLINEs
illusions, dropping of errors, dropping of attachments and cruelty, toosNEWLINEs
little awareness. That's what the world is suffering from, not from asNEWLINEs
lack of religion. Religion is supposed to be about a lack of awareness,sNEWLINEs
of waking up. Look what we've degenerated into.sNEWLINEs

Come to my country and see them killing one another over religion.sNEWLINEs
You'll find it everywhere. "The one who knows, does not say; the onesNEWLINEs
who says, does not know". All revelations, however divine, are neversNEWLINEs
any more than a finger pointing to the moon. As we say in the East,sNEWLINEs
"When the sage points to the moon, all the idiot sees is the finger".sNEWLINEs
Jean Guiton, a very pious and orthodox French writer, adds asNEWLINEs
terrifying comment "We often use the finger to gouge eyes out". Isn'tsNEWLINEs
that terrible? Awareness, awareness, awareness! In awareness issNEWLINEs
healing; in awareness is truth; in awareness is salvation; insNEWLINEs
awareness is spirituality; in awareness is growth; in awareness issNEWLINEs
love; in awareness is awakening. Awareness.sNEWLINEs

I need to talk about words and concepts because I must explain tosNEWLINEs
you why it is, when we look at a tree, we really don't see. We thinksNEWLINEs
we do, but we don't. When we look at a person, we really don't seesNEWLINEs
that person, we only think we do. What we're seeing is somethingsNEWLINEs
that we fixed in our mind. We get an impression and we hold on tosNEWLINEs
that impression, and we keep looking at a person through thatsNEWLINEs
impression.sNEWLINEs

And we do this with almost everything. If you understand that, yousNEWLINEs
will understand the loveliness and beauty of being aware ofsNEWLINEs
everything around you. Because reality is there; "God", whatever thatsNEWLINEs
is, is there. It's all there. The poor little fish in the ocean says,sNEWLINEs
"Excuse me, I 'm looking for the ocean. Can you tell me where I cansNEWLINEs
find it"? Pathetic, isn't it? If we would just open our eyes and see,sNEWLINEs
then we would understand.sNEWLINEs

LOSING THE RAT RACEsNEWLINEs
31sNEWLINEs

Lets get back to that marvelous sentence in the gospel about losingsNEWLINEs
oneself in order to find oneself. One finds it in most religioussNEWLINEs
literature and in all religious and spiritual and mystical literature. HowsNEWLINEs
does one lose oneself? Did you ever try to lose something? That'ssNEWLINEs
right, the harder you try, the harder it gets. It's when you're notsNEWLINEs
trying that you lose things. You lose something when you're notsNEWLINEs
aware. Well, how does one die to oneself? We're talking about deathsNEWLINEs
now, we're not talking about suicide. We're not told to kill the self,sNEWLINEs
but to die. Causing pain to the self, causing suffering to the selfsNEWLINEs
would be self-defeating. It would be counterproductive. You're neversNEWLINEs
so full of yourself as when you're in pain.sNEWLINEs

You're never so centered on yourself as when you're depressed.sNEWLINEs
You're never so ready to forget yourself as when you are happy.sNEWLINEs
Happiness releases you from self. It is suffering and pain and miserysNEWLINEs
and depression that tie you to the self. Look how conscious you are ofsNEWLINEs
your tooth when you have a toothache. When you don't have asNEWLINEs
toothache, you're not even aware you have a tooth, or that you havesNEWLINEs
a head, for that matter, when you don't have a headache. But it's sosNEWLINEs
different when you have a splitting headache.sNEWLINEs

So it's quite false, quite erroneous, to think that the way to deny thesNEWLINEs
self is to cause pain to the self, to go in for abnegation, mortification,sNEWLINEs





as these were traditionally understood. To deny the self, to die to it,sNEWLINEs
to lose it, is to understand its true nature. When you do that, it willsNEWLINEs
disappear; it will vanish. Suppose somebody walks into my room onesNEWLINEs
day. I say, "Come right in. May I know who you are"? And he says, "IsNEWLINEs
am Napoleon". And I say, "Not the Napoleon . . ". And he says,sNEWLINEs
"Precisely. Bonaparte, Emperor of France". "What do you know"! IsNEWLINEs
say, even while I'm thinking to myself, "I better handle this guy withsNEWLINEs
care". "Sit down. Your Majesty", I say. He says, "Well, they tell mesNEWLINEs
you're a pretty good spiritual director. I have a spiritual problem. I'msNEWLINEs
anxious, I'm finding it hard to trust in God. I have my armies insNEWLINEs
Russia, see, and I'm spending sleepless nights wondering how it'ssNEWLINEs
going to turn out". So I say, "Well, Your Majesty, I could certainlysNEWLINEs
prescribe something for that. What I suggest is that you read chaptersNEWLINEs
6 of Matthew: "Consider the lilies of the field . . . they neither toil norsNEWLINEs
spin".sNEWLINEs

By this point I'm wondering who is crazier, this guy or me. But I gosNEWLINEs
along with this lunatic. That's what the wise guru does with you in thesNEWLINEs
beginning. He goes along with you; he takes your troubles seriously.sNEWLINEs
He'll wipe a tear or two from your eye. You're crazy, but you don'tsNEWLINEs
know it yet. The time has to come soon when he'll pull the rug outsNEWLINEs
from under your feet and tell you, "Get off it, you're not Napoleon".sNEWLINEs
In those famous dialogues of St. Catherine of Siena, God is reportedsNEWLINEs
to have said to her, "I am He who is; you are she who is not". HavesNEWLINEs
you ever experienced your is-not-ness?sNEWLINEs

I n the East we have an image for this. 1 1 is the image of the dancersNEWLINEs
and the dance. God is viewed as the dancer and creation as God'ssNEWLINEs
dance. It isn't as if God is the big dancer and you are the littlesNEWLINEs
dancer. Oh no. You're not a dancer at all. You are being danced! DidsNEWLINEs
you ever experience that? So when the man comes to his senses andsNEWLINEs
realizes that he is not Napoleon, he does not cease to be. HesNEWLINEs
continues to be, but he suddenly realizes that he is something othersNEWLINEs
than what he thought he was.sNEWLINEs

To lose the self is to suddenly realize that you are something othersNEWLINEs
than what you thought you were. You thought you were at thesNEWLINEs
center; now you experience yourself as satellite. You thought yousNEWLINEs
were the dancer; you now experience yourself as the dance. ThesesNEWLINEs
are just analogies, images, so you cannot take them literally. TheysNEWLINEs
just give you a clue, a hint; they're only pointers, don't forget. So yousNEWLINEs
cannot press them too much. Don't take them too literally.sNEWLINEs









PERMANENT WORTHsNEWLINEs
32sNEWLINEs

To move on to another idea, there is the whole matter of one'ssNEWLINEs
personal worth. Personal worth doesn't mean self-worth. Where dosNEWLINEs
you get self-worth from? Do you get it from success in your work? DosNEWLINEs
you get it from having a lot of money? Do you get it from attracting asNEWLINEs
lot of men (if you're a woman) or a lot of women (if you're a man)?sNEWLINEs
How fragile all that is, how transitory. When we talk about self-worth,sNEWLINEs
are we not talking, really, about how we are reflected in the mirrorssNEWLINEs
of other people's minds? But do we need to depend on that? OnesNEWLINEs
understands one's personal worth when one no longer identifies orsNEWLINEs
defines one's self in terms of these transient things. I 'm not beautifulsNEWLINEs
because everyone says I'm beautiful. I'm really neither beautiful norsNEWLINEs
ugly.sNEWLINEs

These are things that come and go. I could be suddenly transformedsNEWLINEs
into a very ugly creature tomorrow, but it is still "I". Then, say, I getsNEWLINEs
plastic surgery and I become beautiful again. Does the "I" reallysNEWLINEs
become beautiful? You need to give a lot of time to reflect on thesesNEWLINEs
things. I 've thrown them at you in rapid succession, but if you wouldsNEWLINEs
take the time to understand what I have been saying, to dwell on it,sNEWLINEs
you'll have a gold mine there. I know, because when I stumbled uponsNEWLINEs
these things for the first time, what a treasure I discovered.sNEWLINEs

Pleasant experiences make life delightful. Painful experiences lead tosNEWLINEs
growth. Pleasant experiences make life delightful, but they don't leadsNEWLINEs
to growth in themselves. What leads to growth is painful experiences.sNEWLINEs
Suffering points up an area in you where you have not yet grown,sNEWLINEs
where you need to grow and be transformed and change. If you knewsNEWLINEs
how to use that suffering, oh, how you would grow. Let's limitsNEWLINEs
ourselves, for the time being, to psychological suffering, to all thosesNEWLINEs
negative emotions we have. Don't waste your time on a single one ofsNEWLINEs
them. I 've already told you what you could do with those emotions.sNEWLINEs
The disappointment you experience when things don't turn out as yousNEWLINEs
wanted them to, watch that! Look at what it says about you. I saysNEWLINEs
this without condemnation (otherwise you're going to get caught upsNEWLINEs
in self-hatred). Observe it as you would observe it in another person.sNEWLINEs
Look at that disappointment, that depression you experience whensNEWLINEs
you are criticized. What does that say about you?sNEWLINEs







Have you heard about the fellow who said, "Who says that worrysNEWLINEs
doesn't help? It certainly does help. Every time I worry aboutsNEWLINEs
something it doesn't happen"! Well, it certainly helped him. Or thesNEWLINEs
other fellow who says, "The neurotic is a person who worries aboutsNEWLINEs
something that did not happen in the past. He's not like us normalsNEWLINEs
people who worry about things that will not happen in the future".sNEWLINEs
That's the issue. That worry, that anxiety, what does it say aboutsNEWLINEs
you? Negative feelings, every negative feeling is useful forsNEWLINEs
awareness, for understanding. They give you the opportunity to feelsNEWLINEs
it, to watch it from the outside. In the beginning, the depression willsNEWLINEs
still be there, but you will have cut your connection with it.sNEWLINEs

Gradually you will understand the depression. As you understand it, itsNEWLINEs
will occur less frequently, and will disappear altogether. Maybe, butsNEWLINEs
by that time it won't matter too much. Before enlightenment I usedsNEWLINEs
to be depressed. After enlightenment I continue to be depressed. ButsNEWLINEs
gradually, or rapidly, or suddenly, you get the state of wakefulness.sNEWLINEs
This is the state where you drop desires. But remember what I meantsNEWLINEs
by desire and cravings. I meant: "Unless I get what I desire, I refusesNEWLINEs
to be happy". I mean cases where happiness depends on thesNEWLINEs
fulfillment of desire.sNEWLINEs



DESIRE, NOT PREFERENCEsNEWLINEs
33sNEWLINEs

Do not suppress desire, because then you would become lifeless.sNEWLINEs
You'd be without energy and that would be terrible. Desire in thesNEWLINEs
healthy sense of the word is energy, and the more energy we have,sNEWLINEs
the better. But don't suppress desire, understand it. Understand it.sNEWLINEs
Don't seek to fulfill desire so much as to understand desire. And don'tsNEWLINEs
just renounce the objects of your desire, understand them; see themsNEWLINEs
in their true light. See them for what they are really worth. Because ifsNEWLINEs
you just suppress your desire, and you attempt to renounce thesNEWLINEs
object of your desire, you are likely to be tied to it. Whereas if yousNEWLINEs
look at it and see it for what it is really worth, if you understand howsNEWLINEs
you are preparing the grounds for misery and disappointment andsNEWLINEs
depression, your desire will then be transformed into what I call asNEWLINEs
preference.sNEWLINEs

When you go through life with preferences but don't let yoursNEWLINEs







happiness depend on any one of them, then you're awake. You'resNEWLINEs
moving toward wal&lt;efulness. Wal&lt;efulness, happiness - call it whatsNEWLINEs
you wish - is the state of nondelusion, where you see things not assNEWLINEs
you are but as they are, insofar as this is possible for a human being.sNEWLINEs
To drop illusions, to see things, to see reality. Every time you aresNEWLINEs
unhappy, you have added something to reality. It is that addition thatsNEWLINEs
makes you unhappy. I repeat: You have added something ... asNEWLINEs
negative reaction in you. Reality provides the stimulus, you providesNEWLINEs
the reaction. You have added something by your reaction. And if yousNEWLINEs
examine what you have added, there is always an illusion there,sNEWLINEs
there's a demand, an expectation, a craving. Always. Examples ofsNEWLINEs
illusions abound. But as you begin to move ahead on this path, you'llsNEWLINEs
discover them for yourself.sNEWLINEs

For instance, the illusion, the error of thinking that, by changing thesNEWLINEs
exterior world, you will change. You do not change if you merelysNEWLINEs
change your exterior world. If you get yourself a new job or a newsNEWLINEs
spouse or a new home or a new guru or a new spirituality, that doessNEWLINEs
not change you. It's like imagining that you change your handwritingsNEWLINEs
by changing your pen. Or that you change your capacity to think bysNEWLINEs
changing your hat. That doesn't change you really, but most peoplesNEWLINEs
spend all their energies trying to rearrange their exterior world to suitsNEWLINEs
their tastes. Sometimes they succeed - for about five minutes theysNEWLINEs
get a little respite, but they are tense even during that respite,sNEWLINEs
because life is always flowing, life-is always changing.sNEWLINEs

So if you want to live, you must have no permanent abode. You mustsNEWLINEs
have no place to rest your head. You have to flow with it. As thesNEWLINEs
great Confucius said, "The one who would be constant in happinesssNEWLINEs
must frequently change". Flow. But we keep looking back, don't we?sNEWLINEs
We cling to things in the past and cling to things in the present.sNEWLINEs
"When you set your hand to the plow, you cannot look back". Do yousNEWLINEs
want to enjoy a melody? Do you want to enjoy a symphony? Don'tsNEWLINEs
hold on to a few bars of the music. Don't hold on to a couple of notes.sNEWLINEs
Let them pass, let them flow.sNEWLINEs

The whole enjoyment of a symphony lies in your readiness to allowsNEWLINEs
the notes to pass. Whereas if a particular bar took your fancy andsNEWLINEs
you shouted to the orchestra, "Keep playing it again and again andsNEWLINEs
again", that wouldn't be a symphony anymore. Are you familiar withsNEWLINEs
those tales of Nasr-ed-Din, the old mullah? He's a legendary figuresNEWLINEs
whom the Greeks, Turks, and Persians all claim for themselves. HesNEWLINEs
would give his mystical teachings in the form of stories, generallysNEWLINEs
funny stories. And the butt of the story was always old Nasr-ed-DinsNEWLINEs





himself.sNEWLINEs

One day Nasr-ed-Din was strumming a guitar, playing just one note.sNEWLINEs
After a while a crowd collected around him (this was in asNEWLINEs
marketplace) and one of the men sitting on the ground there said,sNEWLINEs
"That's a nice note you're playing. Mullah, but why don't you vary it asNEWLINEs
bit the way other musicians do"? "Those fools", Nasr-ed-Din said,sNEWLINEs
"they're searching for the right note. I 've found it.sNEWLINEs



CLINGING TO ILLUSIONsNEWLINEs
34sNEWLINEs

When you cling, life is destroyed; when you hold on to anything, yousNEWLINEs
cease to live. It's all over the gospel pages. And one attains this bysNEWLINEs
understanding. Understand. Understand another illusion, too, thatsNEWLINEs
happiness is not the same as excitement, it's not the same as thrills.sNEWLINEs
That's another illusion, that a thrill comes from living a desiresNEWLINEs
fulfilled. Desire breeds anxiety and sooner or later it brings itssNEWLINEs
hangover. When you've suffered sufficiently, then you are ready tosNEWLINEs
see it. You're feeding yourself with thrills. This is like feeding asNEWLINEs
racehorse with delicacies. You're giving it cakes and wine. You don'tsNEWLINEs
feed a racehorse like that. It's like feeding human beings with drugs.sNEWLINEs
You don't fill your stomach with drugs. You need good, solid,sNEWLINEs
nutritious food and drink. You need to understand all this for yourself.sNEWLINEs

Another illusion is that someone else can do this for you, that somesNEWLINEs
savior or guru or teacher can do this for you. Not even the greatestsNEWLINEs
guru in the world can take a single step for you. You've got to take itsNEWLINEs
yourself. St. Augustine said it so marvelously "Jesus Christ himselfsNEWLINEs
could do nothing for many of his hearers". Or to repeat that lovelysNEWLINEs
Arab saying "The nature of the rain is the same and yet it producessNEWLINEs
thorns in the marsh and flowers in the garden". It is you who have tosNEWLINEs
do it. No one else can help you. It is you who have to digest yoursNEWLINEs
food, it is you who have to understand. No one else can understandsNEWLINEs
for you. It is you who have to seek. Nobody can seek for you. And ifsNEWLINEs
what you seek is truth, then you must do this. You can lean on nosNEWLINEs
one.sNEWLINEs

There is yet another illusion, that is it important to be respectable, tosNEWLINEs
be loved and appreciated, to be important. Many say we have asNEWLINEs
natural urge to be loved and appreciated, to belong. That's false.sNEWLINEs





Drop this illusion and you will find happiness. We have a natural urgesNEWLINEs
to be free, a natural urge to love, but not to be loved. Sometimes insNEWLINEs
my psychotherapy sessions I encounter a very common problem -sNEWLINEs
Nobody loves me; how, then, can I be happy? I explain to him or hersNEWLINEs
"You mean you never have any moments when you forget you're notsNEWLINEs
loved and you let go and are happy"? Of course they have.sNEWLINEs

A woman, for example, is absorbed in a movie. It's a comedy andsNEWLINEs
she's roaring with laughter and in that blessed moment she'ssNEWLINEs
forgotten to remind herself that nobody loves her, nobody loves her,sNEWLINEs
nobody loves her. She's happy! Then she comes out of the theatersNEWLINEs
and her friend whom she saw the movie with goes off with asNEWLINEs
boyfriend, leaving the woman all alone. So she starts thinking, "AllsNEWLINEs
my friends have boyfriends and I have no one. I 'm so unhappy.sNEWLINEs
Nobody loves me"!sNEWLINEs

I n I ndia, many of our poor people are starting to get transistorsNEWLINEs
radios, which are quite a luxury. "Everybody has a transistor", yousNEWLINEs
hear, "but I don't have a transistor; I'm so unhappy". Until everyonesNEWLINEs
started getting transistors, they were perfectly happy without one.sNEWLINEs
That's the way it is with you. Until somebody told you you wouldn'tsNEWLINEs
be happy unless you were loved, you were perfectly happy. You cansNEWLINEs
become happy not being loved, not being desired by or attractive tosNEWLINEs
someone. You become happy by contact with reality. That's whatsNEWLINEs
brings happiness, a moment-by-moment contact with reality. That'ssNEWLINEs
where you'll find God; that's where you'll find happiness. But mostsNEWLINEs
people are not ready to hear that.sNEWLINEs

Another illusion is that external events have the power to hurt you,sNEWLINEs
that other people have the power to hurt you. They don't. It's yousNEWLINEs
who give this power to them.sNEWLINEs

Another illusion You are all those labels that people have put on you,sNEWLINEs
or that you have put on yourself. You're not, you're not! So you don'tsNEWLINEs
have to cling to them. The day that somebody tells me I 'm a geniussNEWLINEs
and I take that seriously, I'm in big trouble. Can you understandsNEWLINEs
why? Because now I 'm going to start getting tense. I 've got to live upsNEWLINEs
to it, I 've got to maintain it. I 've got to find out after every lecturesNEWLINEs
"Did you like the lecture? Do you still think I'm a genius"? See? SosNEWLINEs
what you need to do is smash the label! Smash it, and you're free!sNEWLINEs
Don't identify with those labels.sNEWLINEs

That's what someone else thinks. That's how he experienced you atsNEWLINEs
that moment. Are you in fact a genius? Are you a nut? Are you asNEWLINEs





mystic? Are you crazy? What does it really matter? Provided yousNEWLINEs
continue to be aware, to live life from moment to moment. HowsNEWLINEs
marvelously it is described in those words of the gospel "Look at thesNEWLINEs
birds of the air they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns . . .sNEWLINEs
Consider the lilies of the field . . . they neither toil nor spin". That'ssNEWLINEs
the real mystic speaking, the awakened person.sNEWLINEs

So why are you anxious? Can you, for all your anxieties, add a singlesNEWLINEs
moment to your life? Why bother about tomorrow? Is there a lifesNEWLINEs
after death? Will I survive after death? Why bother about tomorrow?sNEWLINEs
Get into today. Someone said, "Life is something that happens to ussNEWLINEs
while we're busy making other plans". That's pathetic. Live in thesNEWLINEs
present moment. This is one of the things you will notice happeningsNEWLINEs
to you as you come awake. You find yourself living in the present,sNEWLINEs
tasting every moment as you live it. Another fairly good sign is whensNEWLINEs
you hear the symphony one note after the other without wanting tosNEWLINEs
stop it.sNEWLINEs



HUGGING MEMORIESsNEWLINEs
35sNEWLINEs

That brings me to another theme, another topic. But this new topicsNEWLINEs
ties in very much with what I've been saying and with my suggestionsNEWLINEs
of becoming aware of all the things we add to reality. Let's take thissNEWLINEs
one step at a time.sNEWLINEs

A J esuit was telling me the other day how years ago he gave a talk insNEWLINEs
New York, where Puerto Ricans were very unpopular at the timesNEWLINEs
because of some incident. Everybody was saying all kinds of thingssNEWLINEs
against them. So in his talk he said, "Let me read to you some of thesNEWLINEs
things that the people in New York were saying about certainsNEWLINEs
immigrants". What he read to them was actually what people hadsNEWLINEs
said about the Irish, and about the Germans, and about every othersNEWLINEs
wave of emigrants that had come to New York years before!sNEWLINEs

He put it very well when he said, "These people don't bringsNEWLINEs
delinquency with them; they become delinquent when they're facedsNEWLINEs
with certain situations here. We've got to understand them. If yousNEWLINEs
want to cure the situation, it's useless reacting from prejudice. YousNEWLINEs
need understanding, not condemnation". That is how you bring aboutsNEWLINEs
change in yourself. Not by condemnation, not by calling yourselfsNEWLINEs





names, but by understanding what's going on. Not by calling yourselfsNEWLINEs
a dirty old sinner. No, no, no, no!sNEWLINEs

In order to get awareness, you've got to see, and you can't see ifsNEWLINEs
you're prejudiced. Almost everything and every person we look at, wesNEWLINEs
look at in a prejudiced way. It's almost enough to disheartensNEWLINEs
anybody.sNEWLINEs

Like meeting a long-lost friend. "Hey, Tom", I say, "It's good to seesNEWLINEs
you", and I give him a big hug. Whom am I hugging, Tom or mysNEWLINEs
memory of him? A living human being or a corpse? I'm assuming thatsNEWLINEs
he's still the attractive guy I thought he was. I'm assuming he still fitssNEWLINEs
in with the idea I have of him and with my memories andsNEWLINEs
associations. So I give him a hug. Five minutes later I find that he'ssNEWLINEs
changed and I have no more interest in him. I hugged the wrongsNEWLINEs
person. If you want to see how true this is, listen: A religious sistersNEWLINEs
from India goes out to make a retreat. Everybody in the communitysNEWLINEs
is saying, "Oh, we know, that's part of her charisma; she's alwayssNEWLINEs
attending workshops and going to retreats; nothing will ever changesNEWLINEs
her". Now, it so happens that the sister does change at this particularsNEWLINEs
workshop, or therapy group, or whatever it is.sNEWLINEs

She changes; everyone notices the difference. Everyone says, "My,sNEWLINEs
you've really come to some insights, haven't you"? She has, and theysNEWLINEs
can see the difference in her behavior, in her body, in her face. YousNEWLINEs
always do when there's an inner change. It always registers in yoursNEWLINEs
face, in your eyes, in your body. Well, the sister goes back to hersNEWLINEs
community, and since the community has a prejudiced, fixed ideasNEWLINEs
about her, they're going to continue to look at her through the eyessNEWLINEs
of that prejudice.sNEWLINEs

They're the only ones who don't see any change in her. They say,sNEWLINEs
"Oh well, she seems a little more spirited, but just wait, she'll besNEWLINEs
depressed again". And within a few weeks she is depressed again;sNEWLINEs
she's reacting to their reaction. And they all say, "See, we told yousNEWLINEs
so; she hadn't changed". But the tragedy is that she had, only theysNEWLINEs
didn't see it. Perception has devastating consequences in the mattersNEWLINEs
of love and human relationships.sNEWLINEs

Whatever a relationship may be, it certainly entails two things claritysNEWLINEs
of perception (inasmuch as we're capable of it; some people wouldsNEWLINEs
dispute to what extent we can attain clarity of perception, but I don'tsNEWLINEs
think anyone would dispute that it is desirable that we move towardsNEWLINEs
it) and accuracy of response. You're more likely to respond accuratelysNEWLINEs





when you perceive clearly. When your perception is distorted, you'resNEWLINEs
not likely to respond accurately. How can you love someone whomsNEWLINEs
you do not even see? Do you really see someone you are attachedsNEWLINEs
to? Do you really see someone you're afraid of and therefore dislike?sNEWLINEs
We always hate what we fear.sNEWLINEs

"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom", people say to mesNEWLINEs
sometimes. But wait a minute. I hope they understand what they'resNEWLINEs
saying, because we always hate what we fear. We always want tosNEWLINEs
destroy and get rid of and avoid what we fear. When you fearsNEWLINEs
somebody, you dislike that person. You dislike that person insofar assNEWLINEs
you fear that person. And you don't see that person either, becausesNEWLINEs
your emotion gets in the way. Now, that's just as true when you aresNEWLINEs
attracted to someone. When true love enters, you no longer like orsNEWLINEs
even dislike people in the ordinary sense of the word.sNEWLINEs

You see them clearly and you respond accurately. But at this humansNEWLINEs
level, your likes and dislikes and preferences and attractions, etc.,sNEWLINEs
continue to get in the way. So you have to be aware of yoursNEWLINEs
prejudices, your likes, your dislikes, your attractions. They're allsNEWLINEs
there, they come from your conditioning. How come you like thingssNEWLINEs
that I don't like? Because your culture is different from mine. YoursNEWLINEs
upbringing is different from mine. If I gave you some of the things tosNEWLINEs
eat that I relish, you'd turn away in disgust.sNEWLINEs

There are people in certain parts of India who love dog flesh. YetsNEWLINEs
others, if they were told they were being served dog steak, would feelsNEWLINEs
sick. Why? Different conditioning, different programming. HindussNEWLINEs
would feel sick if they knew they had eaten beef, but AmericanssNEWLINEs
enjoy it. You ask, "But why won't they eat beef"? For the samesNEWLINEs
reason you won't eat your pet dog. The same reason. The cow, to thesNEWLINEs
Indian peasant, is what your pet dog is to you. He doesn't want tosNEWLINEs
eat it. There is a built-in cultural prejudice against it which saves ansNEWLINEs
animal that's needed so much for farming, etc.sNEWLINEs

So why do I fall in love with a person really? Why is it that I fall insNEWLINEs
love with one kind of person and not another? Because I'msNEWLINEs
conditioned. I've got an image, subconsciously, that this particularsNEWLINEs
type of person appeals to me, attracts me. So when I meet thissNEWLINEs
person, I fall head over heels in love. But have I seen her? No! I'll seesNEWLINEs
her after I marry her; that's when the awakening comes! And that'ssNEWLINEs
when love may begin.sNEWLINEs

But falling in love has nothing to do with love at all. It isn't love, it'ssNEWLINEs





desire, burning desire. You want, with all your heart, to be told bysNEWLINEs
this adorable creature that you're attractive to her. That gives you asNEWLINEs
tremendous sensation. Meanwhile, everybody else is saying, "WhatsNEWLINEs
the hell does he see in her"? But it's his conditioning - he's notsNEWLINEs
seeing. They say that love is blind. Believe me, there's nothing sosNEWLINEs
clear-sighted as true love, nothing. It's the most clear-sighted thingsNEWLINEs
in the world. Addiction is blind, attachments are blind.sNEWLINEs

Clinging, craving, and desire are blind. But not true love. Don't callsNEWLINEs
them love. But, of course, the word has been desecrated in mostsNEWLINEs
modern languages. People talk about making love and falling in love.sNEWLINEs
Like the little boy who says to the little girl, "Have you ever fallen insNEWLINEs
love"? And she answers, "No, but I've fallen in like".sNEWLINEs

So what are people talking about when they fall in love? The firstsNEWLINEs
thing we need is clarity of perception. One reason we don't perceivesNEWLINEs
people clearly is evident - our emotions get in the way, oursNEWLINEs
conditioning, our likes and dislikes. We've got to grapple with thatsNEWLINEs
fact. But we've got to grapple with something much moresNEWLINEs
fundamental - with our ideas, with our conclusions, with oursNEWLINEs
concepts.sNEWLINEs

Believe it or not, every concept that was meant to help us get insNEWLINEs
touch with reality ends up by being a barrier to getting in touch withsNEWLINEs
reality, because sooner or later we forget that the words are not thesNEWLINEs
thing. The concept is not the same as the reality. They're different.sNEWLINEs
That's why I said to you earlier that the final barrier to finding God issNEWLINEs
the word "God" itself and the concept of God. It gets in the way ifsNEWLINEs
you're not careful. It was meant to be a help; it can be a help, but itsNEWLINEs
can also be a barrier.sNEWLINEs



GETTING CONCRETEsNEWLINEs
36sNEWLINEs

Every time I have a concept, it is something that I could apply to asNEWLINEs
number of individuals. We're not talking about a concrete, particularsNEWLINEs
name like Mary or John, which doesn't have a conceptual meaning. AsNEWLINEs
concept applies to any number of individuals, countless individuals.sNEWLINEs
Concepts are universal. For instance, the word "leaf" could be appliedsNEWLINEs
to every single leaf on a tree; the same word applies to all thosesNEWLINEs
individual leaves. Moreover, the same word applies to all the leavessNEWLINEs





on all trees, big ones, small ones, tender ones, dried ones, yellowsNEWLINEs
ones, green ones, banana leaves. So if I say to you that I saw a leafsNEWLINEs
this morning, you really don't have an idea of what I saw.sNEWLINEs

Let's see if you can understand that. You do have an idea of what IsNEWLINEs
did not see. I did not see an animal. I did not see a dog. I did not seesNEWLINEs
a human being. I did not see a shoe. So you have some kind of asNEWLINEs
vague idea of what I saw, but it isn't particularized, it isn't concrete.sNEWLINEs
"Human being" refers not to primitive man, not to civilized man, notsNEWLINEs
to grownup man, not to a child, not to a male or a female, not to thissNEWLINEs
particular age or another, not to this culture or the other, but to thesNEWLINEs
concept. The human being is found concrete; you never find asNEWLINEs
universal human being like your concept. So your concept points, butsNEWLINEs
it is never entirely accurate; it misses uniqueness, concreteness. ThesNEWLINEs
concept is universal.sNEWLINEs

When I give you a concept, I give you something, and yet how little IsNEWLINEs
have given you. The concept is so valuable, so useful for science. ForsNEWLINEs
instance, if I say that everyone here is an animal, that would besNEWLINEs
perfectly accurate from a scientific viewpoint. But we're somethingsNEWLINEs
more than animals. If I say that Mary J ane is an animal, that's true;sNEWLINEs
but because I've omitted something essential about her, it's false; itsNEWLINEs
does her an injustice. When I call a person a woman, that's true; butsNEWLINEs
there are lots of things in that person that don't fit into the conceptsNEWLINEs
"woman". She is always this particular, concrete, unique woman, whosNEWLINEs
can only be experienced, not conceptualized. The concrete personsNEWLINEs
I've got to see for myself, to experience for myself, to intuit forsNEWLINEs
myself. The individual can be intuited but cannot be conceptualized.sNEWLINEs

A person is beyond the thinking mind. Many of you would probably besNEWLINEs
proud to be called Americans, as many Indians would probably besNEWLINEs
proud to be called Indians. But what is "American", what is "Indian"?sNEWLINEs
It's a convention; it's not part of your nature. All you've got is a label.sNEWLINEs
You really don't know the person. The concept always misses or omitssNEWLINEs
something extremely important, something precious that is onlysNEWLINEs
found in reality, which is concrete uniqueness.sNEWLINEs

The great Krishnamurti put it so well when he said, "The day yousNEWLINEs
teach the child the name of the bird, the child will never see that birdsNEWLINEs
again". How true! The first time the child sees that fluffy, alive,sNEWLINEs
moving object, and you say to him, "Sparrow", then tomorrow whensNEWLINEs
the child sees another fluffy, moving object similar to it he says, "Oh,sNEWLINEs
sparrows. I've seen sparrows. I'm bored by sparrows".sNEWLINEs







If you don't look at things through your concepts, you'll never besNEWLINEs
bored. Every single thing is unique. Every sparrow is unlike everysNEWLINEs
other sparrow despite the similarities. It's a great help to havesNEWLINEs
similarities, so we can abstract, so that we can have a concept. It's asNEWLINEs
great help, from the point of view of communication, education,sNEWLINEs
science. But it's also very misleading and a great hindrance to seeingsNEWLINEs
this concrete individual. If all you experience is your concept, you'resNEWLINEs
not experiencing reality, because reality is concrete. The concept is asNEWLINEs
help, to lead you to reality, but when you get there, you've got tosNEWLINEs
intuit or experience it directly.sNEWLINEs

A second quality of a concept is that it is static whereas reality is insNEWLINEs
flux. We use the same name for Niagara Falls, but that body of watersNEWLINEs
is constantly changing. You've got the word "river", but the watersNEWLINEs
there is constantly flowing. You've got one word for your "body", butsNEWLINEs
the cells in your body are constantly being renewed. Let's suppose,sNEWLINEs
for example, there is an enormous wind outside and I want thesNEWLINEs
people in my country to get an idea of what an American gale orsNEWLINEs
hurricane is like.sNEWLINEs

So I capture it in a cigar box and I go back home and say, "Look atsNEWLINEs
this". Naturally, it isn't a gale anymore, is it? Once it's captured. Or ifsNEWLINEs
I want you to get the feel of what the flow of a river is like and IsNEWLINEs
bring it to you in a bucket. The moment I put into a bucket it hassNEWLINEs
stopped flowing. The moment you put things into a concept, theysNEWLINEs
stop flowing; they become static, dead. A frozen wave is not a wave.sNEWLINEs
A wave is essentially movement, action; when you freeze it, it is notsNEWLINEs
a wave. Concepts are always frozen. Reality flows.sNEWLINEs

Finally, if we are to believe the mystics (and it doesn't take too muchsNEWLINEs
of an effort to understand this, or even believe it, but no one can seesNEWLINEs
it at once), reality is whole, but words and concepts fragment reality.sNEWLINEs
That is why it is so difficult to translate from one language to another,sNEWLINEs
because each language cuts reality up differently. The English wordsNEWLINEs
"home" is impossible to translate into French or Spanish. "Casa" issNEWLINEs
not quite "home"; "home" has associations that are peculiar to thesNEWLINEs
English language.sNEWLINEs

Every language has untranslatable words and expressions, becausesNEWLINEs
we're cutting reality up and adding something or subtractingsNEWLINEs
something and usage keeps changing. Reality is a whole and we cut itsNEWLINEs
up to make concepts and we use words to indicate different parts. IfsNEWLINEs
you had never seen an animal in your life, for example, and one daysNEWLINEs
you found a tail -- just a tail -- and somebody told you, "That's asNEWLINEs





tail", would you have any idea of what it was if you had no idea whatsNEWLINEs
an animal was?sNEWLINEs

Ideas actually fragment the vision, intuition, or experience of realitysNEWLINEs
as a whole. This is what the mystics are perpetually telling us. WordssNEWLINEs
cannot give you reality. They only point, they only indicate. You usesNEWLINEs
them as pointers to get to reality. But once you get there, yoursNEWLINEs
concepts are useless. A Hindu priest once had a dispute with asNEWLINEs
philosopher who claimed that the final barrier to God was the wordsNEWLINEs
"God", the concept of God.sNEWLINEs

The priest was quite shocked by this, but the philosopher said, "ThesNEWLINEs
ass that you mount and that you use to travel to a house is not thesNEWLINEs
means by which you enter the house. You use the concept to getsNEWLINEs
there; then you dismount, you go beyond it". You don't need to be asNEWLINEs
mystic to understand that reality is something that cannot besNEWLINEs
captured by words or concepts. To know reality you have to knowsNEWLINEs
beyond knowing.sNEWLINEs

Do those words ring a bell? Those of you who are familiar with ThesNEWLINEs
Cloud of Unknowing would recognize the expression. Poets, painters,sNEWLINEs
mystics, and the great philosophers all have intimations of its truth.sNEWLINEs
Let's suppose that one day I'm watching a tree. Until now, every timesNEWLINEs
I saw a tree, I said, "Well, it's a tree". But today when I'm looking atsNEWLINEs
the tree, I don't see a tree. At least I don't see what I 'm accustomedsNEWLINEs
to seeing. I see something with the freshness of a child's vision. IsNEWLINEs
have no word for it. I see something unique, whole, flowing, notsNEWLINEs
fragmented. And I'm in awe. If you were to ask me, "What did yousNEWLINEs
see"? what do you think I'd answer? I have no word for it. There is nosNEWLINEs
word for reality. Because as soon as I put a word to it, we're backsNEWLINEs
into concepts again.sNEWLINEs

And if I cannot express this reality that is visible to my senses, howsNEWLINEs
does one express what cannot be seen by the eye or heard by thesNEWLINEs
ear? How does one find a word for the reality of God? Are yousNEWLINEs
beginning to understand what Thomas Aquinas, Augustine, and allsNEWLINEs
the rest were saying and what the Church teaches constantly whensNEWLINEs
she says that God is mystery, is unintelligible to the human mind?sNEWLINEs

The great Karl Rahner, in one of his last letters, wrote to a youngsNEWLINEs
German drug addict who had asked him for help. The addict had said,sNEWLINEs
"You theologians talk about God, but how could this God be relevantsNEWLINEs
in my life? How could this God get me off drugs? Rahner said to him,sNEWLINEs
"I must confess to you in all honesty that for me God is and hassNEWLINEs





always been absolute mystery. I do not understand what God is; nosNEWLINEs
one can. We have intimations, inklings; we make faltering,sNEWLINEs
inadequate attempts to put mystery into words. But there is no wordsNEWLINEs
for it, no sentence for it". And talking to a group of theologians insNEWLINEs
London, Rahner said, "The task of the theologian is to explainsNEWLINEs
everything through God, and to explain God as unexplainable".sNEWLINEs
Unexplainable mystery. One does not know, one cannot say. OnesNEWLINEs
says, "Ah. . . Ah . . ".sNEWLINEs

Words are pointers, they're not descriptions. Tragically, people fallsNEWLINEs
into idolatry because they think that where God is concerned, thesNEWLINEs
word is the thing. How could you get so crazy? Can you be craziersNEWLINEs
than that? Even where human beings are concerned, or trees andsNEWLINEs
leaves and animals, the word is not the thing. And you would saysNEWLINEs
that, where God is concerned, the word is one thing? What are yousNEWLINEs
talking about? An internationally famous scripture scholar attendedsNEWLINEs
this course in San Francisco, and he said to me, "My God, aftersNEWLINEs
listening to you, I understand that I've been an idol worshipper all mysNEWLINEs
life!" He said this openly. "It never struck me that I had been an idolsNEWLINEs
worshipper. My idol was not made of wood or metal; it was a mentalsNEWLINEs
idol". These are the more dangerous idol worshippers. They use asNEWLINEs
very subtle substance, the mind, to produce their God.sNEWLINEs

What I'm leading you to is the following awareness of reality aroundsNEWLINEs
you. Awareness means to watch, to observe what is going on withinsNEWLINEs
you and around you. "Going on" is pretty accurate Trees, grass,sNEWLINEs
flowers, animals, rock, all of reality is moving. One observes it, onesNEWLINEs
watches it. How essential it is for the human being not just tosNEWLINEs
observe himself or herself, but to watch all of reality. Are yousNEWLINEs
imprisoned by your concepts? Do you want to break out of yoursNEWLINEs
prison? Then look; observe; spend hours observing. Watching what?sNEWLINEs
Anything.sNEWLINEs

The faces of people, the shapes of trees, a bird in flight, a pile ofsNEWLINEs
stones, watch the grass grow. Get in touch with things, look at them.sNEWLINEs
Hopefully you will then break out of these rigid patterns we have allsNEWLINEs
developed, out of what our thoughts and our words have imposed onsNEWLINEs
us. Hopefully we will see. What will we see? This thing that we choosesNEWLINEs
to call reality, whatever is beyond words and concepts. This is asNEWLINEs
spiritual exercise connected with spirituality connected with breakingsNEWLINEs
out of your cage, out of the imprisonment of the concepts and words.sNEWLINEs

How sad if we pass through life and never see it with the eyes of asNEWLINEs
child. This doesn't mean you should drop your concepts totally;sNEWLINEs





they're very precious. Though we begin without them, concepts havesNEWLINEs
a very positive function. Thanl&lt;s to them we develop our intelligence.sNEWLINEs
We're invited, not to become children, but to become like children.sNEWLINEs
We do have to fall from a stage of innocence and be thrown out ofsNEWLINEs
paradise; we do have to develop an "I" and a "me" through thesesNEWLINEs
concepts. But then we need to return to paradise.sNEWLINEs

We need to be redeemed again. We need to put off the old man, thesNEWLINEs
old nature, the conditioned self, and return to the state of the childsNEWLINEs
but without being a child. When we start off in life, we look at realitysNEWLINEs
with wonder, but it isn't the intelligent wonder of the mystics; it's thesNEWLINEs
formless wonder of the child. Then wonder dies and is replaced bysNEWLINEs
boredom, as we develop language and words and concepts. ThensNEWLINEs
hopefully, if we're lucky, we'll return to wonder again.sNEWLINEs



AT A LOSS FOR WORDSsNEWLINEs
37sNEWLINEs

Dag Hammarskjold, the former UN Secretary-General, put it sosNEWLINEs
beautifully "God does not die on the day we cease to believe in asNEWLINEs
personal deity. But we die on the day when our lives cease to besNEWLINEs
illumined by the steady radiance of wonder renewed daily, the sourcesNEWLINEs
of which is beyond all reason". We don't have to quarrel about asNEWLINEs
word, because "God" is only a word, a concept. One never quarrelssNEWLINEs
about reality; we only quarrel about opinions, about concepts, aboutsNEWLINEs
judgments. Drop your concepts, drop your opinions, drop yoursNEWLINEs
prejudices, drop your judgments, and you will see that.sNEWLINEs

"Quia de deo scire non possumus quid sit, sed quid non sit, nonsNEWLINEs
possumus considerare de deo, quomodo sit sed quomodo non sit".sNEWLINEs
This is St. Thomas Aquinas' introduction to his whole SummasNEWLINEs
Theologica "Since we cannot know what God is, but only what God issNEWLINEs
not, we cannot consider how God is but only how He is not". I havesNEWLINEs
already mentioned Thomas' commentary on Boethius' De SanctasNEWLINEs
Trinitate, where he says that the loftiest degree of the knowledge ofsNEWLINEs
God is to know God as the unknown, tamquam ignotum. And in hissNEWLINEs
Questio Disputata de Potentia Dei, Thomas says, "This is what issNEWLINEs
ultimate in the human knowledge of God - to know that we do notsNEWLINEs
know God". This gentleman was considered the prince of theologians.sNEWLINEs
He was a mystic, and is a canonized saint today. We're standing onsNEWLINEs







pretty good ground.sNEWLINEs

I n I ndia, we have a Sanskrit saying for this l&lt;ind of thing "neti, neti".sNEWLINEs
It means "not that, not that". Thomas' own method was referred tosNEWLINEs
as the via negativa, the negative way. C. S. Lewis wrote a diary whilesNEWLINEs
his wife was dying. It's called A Grief Observed. He had married ansNEWLINEs
American woman whom he loved dearly. He told his friends, "GodsNEWLINEs
gave me in my sixties what He denied me in my twenties". He hardlysNEWLINEs
had married her when she died a painful death of cancer. Lewis saidsNEWLINEs
that his whole faith crumbled, like a house of cards. Here he was thesNEWLINEs
great Christian apologist, but when disaster struck home, he askedsNEWLINEs
himself, "Is God a loving Father or is God the great vivisectionist"?sNEWLINEs

There's pretty good evidence for both! I remember that when mysNEWLINEs
own mother got cancer, my sister said to me, "Tony, why did GodsNEWLINEs
allow this to happen to Mother"? I said to her, "My dear, last year asNEWLINEs
million people died of starvation in China because of the drought, andsNEWLINEs
you never raised a question". Sometimes the best thing that cansNEWLINEs
happen to us is to be awakened to reality, for calamity to strike, forsNEWLINEs
then we come to faith, as C. S. Lewis did. He said that he never hadsNEWLINEs
any doubts before about people surviving death, but when his wifesNEWLINEs
died, he was no longer certain. Why? Because it was so important tosNEWLINEs
him that she be living. Lewis, as you know, is the master ofsNEWLINEs
comparisons and analogies.sNEWLINEs

He says, "It's like a rope. Someone says to you, 'Would this bear thesNEWLINEs
weight of a hundred twenty pounds?' You answer, 'Yes.' 'Well, we'resNEWLINEs
going to let down your best friend on this rope.' Then you say, 'Wait asNEWLINEs
minute, let me test that rope again.' You're not so sure now". LewissNEWLINEs
also said in his diary that we cannot know anything about God andsNEWLINEs
even our questions about God are absurd. Why? It's as though asNEWLINEs
person born blind asks you, "The color green, is it hot or cold"? Neti,sNEWLINEs
neti, not that. "Is it long or is it short"? Not that. "Is it sweet or is itsNEWLINEs
sour"? Not that. "Is it round or oval or square"? Not that, not that.sNEWLINEs

The blind person has no words, no concepts, for a color of which hesNEWLINEs
has no idea, no intuition, no experience. You can only speak to him insNEWLINEs
analogies. No matter what he asks, you can only say, "Not that". C.S.sNEWLINEs
Lewis says somewhere that it's like asking how many minutes are insNEWLINEs
the color yellow. Everybody could be taking the question verysNEWLINEs
seriously, discussing it, fighting about it. One person suggests theresNEWLINEs
are twenty-five carrots in the color yellow, the other person says,sNEWLINEs
"No, seventeen potatoes", and they're suddenly fighting. Not that,sNEWLINEs
not that!sNEWLINEs





This is what is ultimate in our human l&lt;nowledge of God, to l&lt;now thatsNEWLINEs
we do not l&lt;now. Our great tragedy is that we l&lt;now too much. WesNEWLINEs
thinl&lt; we l&lt;now, that is our tragedy; so we never discover. I n fact,sNEWLINEs
Thomas Aquinas (he's not only a theologian but also a greatsNEWLINEs
philosopher) says repeatedly, "All the efforts of the human mindsNEWLINEs
cannot exhaust the essence of a single fly".sNEWLINEs



CULTURAL CONDITIONINGsNEWLINEs
38sNEWLINEs

Something more about words.sNEWLINEs

I said to you earlier that words are limited. There is more I have tosNEWLINEs
add. There are some words that correspond to nothing. For instance,sNEWLINEs
I 'm an I ndian. Now, let's suppose that I 'm a prisoner of war insNEWLINEs
Pakistan, and they say to me, "Well, today we're going to take you tosNEWLINEs
the frontier, and you're going to take a look at your country".sNEWLINEs

So they bring me to the frontier, and I look across the border, and IsNEWLINEs
think, "Oh, my country, my beautiful country. I see villages and treessNEWLINEs
and hills. This is my own, my native land!" After a while one of thesNEWLINEs
guards says, "Excuse me, we've made a mistake here. We have tosNEWLINEs
move up another ten miles". What was I reacting to? Nothing. I keptsNEWLINEs
focusing on a word, India. But trees are not India; trees are trees.sNEWLINEs

In fact, there are no frontiers or boundaries. They were put there bysNEWLINEs
the human mind; generally by stupid, avaricious politicians. MysNEWLINEs
country was one country once upon a time; it's four now. If we don'tsNEWLINEs
watch out it might be six. Then we'll have six flags, six armies. That'ssNEWLINEs
why you'll never catch me saluting a flag. I abhor all national flagssNEWLINEs
because they are idols. What are we saluting? I salute humanity, notsNEWLINEs
a flag with an army around it.sNEWLINEs

Flags are in the heads of people. I n any case, there are thousands ofsNEWLINEs
words in our vocabulary that do not correspond to reality at all. ButsNEWLINEs
do they trigger emotions in us! So we begin to see things that are notsNEWLINEs
there. We actually see Indian mountains when they don't exist, andsNEWLINEs
we actually see Indian people who also don't exist. Your AmericansNEWLINEs
conditioning exists. My Indian conditioning exists.sNEWLINEs

But that's not a very happy thing. Nowadays, in Third WorldsNEWLINEs





countries, we talk a great deal about "inculturation". What is thissNEWLINEs
thing called "culture"? I'm not very happy with the word. Does itsNEWLINEs
mean you'd like to do something because you were conditioned to dosNEWLINEs
it? That you'd like to feel something because you were conditioned tosNEWLINEs
feel it? Isn't that being mechanical? Imagine an American baby that issNEWLINEs
adopted by a Russian couple and taken to Russia. It has no notionsNEWLINEs
that it was born American. It's brought up talking Russian; it livessNEWLINEs
and dies for Mother Russia; it hates Americans.sNEWLINEs

The child is stamped with his own culture; it's steeped in its ownsNEWLINEs
literature. It looks at the world through the eyes of its culture. Now, ifsNEWLINEs
you want to wear your culture the way you wear your clothes, that'ssNEWLINEs
fine. The I ndian woman would wear a sari and the American womansNEWLINEs
would wear something else, the Japanese woman would wear hersNEWLINEs
kimono. But nobody identifies herself with the clothes. But you dosNEWLINEs
want to wear your culture more intently. You become proud of yoursNEWLINEs
culture. They teach you to be proud of it.sNEWLINEs

Let me put this as forcefully as possible. There's this J esuit friend ofsNEWLINEs
mine who said to me, "Anytime I see a beggar or a poor person, IsNEWLINEs
cannot not give this person alms. I got that from my mother". HissNEWLINEs
mother would offer a meal to any poor person who passed by. I saidsNEWLINEs
to him, "J oe, what you have is not a virtue; what you have is asNEWLINEs
compulsion, a good one from the point of view of the beggar, but asNEWLINEs
compulsion nonetheless". I remember another Jesuit who said to ussNEWLINEs
once at an intimate gathering of the men of our J esuit province insNEWLINEs
Bombay, "I 'm eighty years old; I 've been a J esuit for sixty-five years.sNEWLINEs

I have never once missed my hour of meditation -- never once".sNEWLINEs
Now, that could be very admirable, or it could also be a compulsion.sNEWLINEs
No great merit in it if it's mechanical. The beauty of an action comessNEWLINEs
not from its having become a habit but from its sensitivity,sNEWLINEs
consciousness, clarity of perception, and accuracy of response. I cansNEWLINEs
say yes to one beggar and no to another. I am not compelled by anysNEWLINEs
conditioning or programming from my past experiences or from mysNEWLINEs
culture. Nobody has stamped anything on me, or if they have, I'm nosNEWLINEs
longer reacting on the basis of that.sNEWLINEs

If you had a bad experience with an American or were bitten by a dogsNEWLINEs
or had a bad experience with a certain type of food, for the rest ofsNEWLINEs
your life you'd be influenced by that experience. And that's bad! YousNEWLINEs
need to be liberated from that. Don't carry over experiences from thesNEWLINEs
past. I n fact, don't carry over good experiences from the past either.sNEWLINEs
Learn what it means to experience something fully, then drop it andsNEWLINEs





move on to the next moment, uninfluenced by the previous one.sNEWLINEs
You'd be traveling with such little baggage that you could passsNEWLINEs
through the eye of a needle.sNEWLINEs

You'd know what eternal is, because eternal life is now, in thesNEWLINEs
timeless now. Only thus will you enter into eternal life. But how manysNEWLINEs
things we carry along with us. We never set about the task of freeingsNEWLINEs
ourselves, of dropping the baggage, of being ourselves. I'm sorry tosNEWLINEs
say that everywhere I go I find Muslims who use their religion, theirsNEWLINEs
worship, and their Koran to distract themselves from this task. AndsNEWLINEs
the same applies to Hindus and Christians.sNEWLINEs

Can you imagine the human being who is no longer influenced bysNEWLINEs
words? You can give him any number of words and he'll still give yousNEWLINEs
a fair deal. You can say, "I'm Cardinal Archbishop So-and-so",sNEWLINEs
but he'll still give you a fair deal; he'll see you as you are. He'ssNEWLINEs
uninfluenced by the label.sNEWLINEs



FILTERED REALITYsNEWLINEs
39sNEWLINEs

I want to say one more thing about our perception of reality. Let mesNEWLINEs
put it in the form of an analogy. The President of the United StatessNEWLINEs
has to get feedback from the citizens. The Pope in Rome has to getsNEWLINEs
feedback from the whole Church. There are literally millions of itemssNEWLINEs
that could be fed to them, but they could hardly take all of them in,sNEWLINEs
much less digest them. So they have people whom they trust tosNEWLINEs
make abstracts, summarize things, monitor, filter; in the end, somesNEWLINEs
of it gets to their desk. Now, this is what's happening to us. FromsNEWLINEs
every pore or living cell of our bodies and from all our senses we aresNEWLINEs
getting feedback from reality. But we are filtering things outsNEWLINEs
constantly. Who's doing the filtering? Our conditioning? Our culture?sNEWLINEs
Our programming?sNEWLINEs

The way we were taught to see things and to experience them? EvensNEWLINEs
our language can be a filter. There is so much filtering going on thatsNEWLINEs
sometimes you won't see things that are there. You only have to looksNEWLINEs
at a paranoid person who's always feeling threatened by somethingsNEWLINEs
that isn't there, who's constantly interpreting reality in terms ofsNEWLINEs
certain experiences of the past or certain conditioning that he or shesNEWLINEs
has had.sNEWLINEs





But there's another demon, too, who's doing the filtering. It's calledsNEWLINEs
attachment, desire, craving. The root of sorrow is craving. CravingsNEWLINEs
distorts and destroys perception. Fears and desires haunt us. SamuelsNEWLINEs
Johnson said, "The knowledge that he is to swing from a scaffoldsNEWLINEs
within a week wonderfully concentrates a man's mind". You blot outsNEWLINEs
everything else and concentrate only on the fear, or desire, orsNEWLINEs
craving. In many ways we were drugged when we were young.sNEWLINEs

We were brought up to need people. For what? For acceptance,sNEWLINEs
approval, appreciation, applause - for what they called success.sNEWLINEs
Those are words that do not correspond to reality. They aresNEWLINEs
conventions, things that are invented, but we don't realize that theysNEWLINEs
don't correspond to reality. What is success? It is what one groupsNEWLINEs
decided is a good thing. Another group will decide the same thing issNEWLINEs
bad. What is good in Washington might be considered bad in asNEWLINEs
Carthusian monastery. Success in a political circle might besNEWLINEs
considered failure in some other circles. These are conventions.sNEWLINEs

But we treat them like realities, don't we? When we were young, wesNEWLINEs
were programmed to unhappiness. They taught us that in order to besNEWLINEs
happy you need money, success, a beautiful or handsome partner insNEWLINEs
life, a good job, friendship, spirituality, God - you name it. Unless yousNEWLINEs
get these things, you're not going to be happy, we were told. Now,sNEWLINEs
that is what I call an attachment. An attachment is a belief thatsNEWLINEs
without something you are not going to be happy. Once you getsNEWLINEs
convinced of that - and it gets into our subconscious, it gets stampedsNEWLINEs
into the roots of our being - you are finished. "How could I be happysNEWLINEs
unless I have good health"? you say.sNEWLINEs

But I 'II tell you something. I have met people dying of cancer whosNEWLINEs
were happy. But how could they be happy if they knew they weresNEWLINEs
going to die? But they were. "How could I be happy if I don't havesNEWLINEs
money"? One person has a million dollars in the bank, and he feelssNEWLINEs
insecure; the other person has practically no money, but he doesn'tsNEWLINEs
seem to feel any insecurity at all. He was programmed differently,sNEWLINEs
that's all. Useless to exhort the first person about what to do; hesNEWLINEs
needs understanding. Exhortations are of no great help. You need tosNEWLINEs
understand that you've been programmed; it's a false belief. See it assNEWLINEs
false, see it as a fantasy.sNEWLINEs

What are people doing all through their lives? They're busy fighting;sNEWLINEs
fight, fight, fight. That's what they call survival. When the averagesNEWLINEs
American says he or she is making a living, it isn't a living they'resNEWLINEs





making, oh no! They have much more than they need to live. ComesNEWLINEs
to my country and you'll see that. You don't need all those cars tosNEWLINEs
live. You don't need a television set to live. You don't need makeup tosNEWLINEs
live. You don't need all those clothes to live. But try to convince thesNEWLINEs
average American of this. They've been brainwashed; they've beensNEWLINEs
programmed.sNEWLINEs

So they work and strive to get the desired object that will make themsNEWLINEs
happy. Listen to this pathetic story — your story, my story,sNEWLINEs
everybody's story: "Until I get this object (money, friendship,sNEWLINEs
anything) I 'm not going to be happy; I 've got to strive to get it andsNEWLINEs
then when I've got it, I've got to strive to keep it. I get a temporarysNEWLINEs
thrill. Oh, I'm so thrilled, I've got it"! But how long does that last? AsNEWLINEs
few minutes, a few days at the most. When you get your brand-newsNEWLINEs
car, how long does the thrill last? Until your next attachment issNEWLINEs
threatened!sNEWLINEs

The truth about a thrill is that I get tired of it after a while. They toldsNEWLINEs
me prayer was the big thing; they told me God was the big thing;sNEWLINEs
they told me friendship was the big thing. And not knowing whatsNEWLINEs
prayer really was or not knowing what God really was, not knowingsNEWLINEs
what friendship really was, we made much out of them. But after asNEWLINEs
while we got bored with them - bored with prayer, with God, withsNEWLINEs
friendship. Isn't that pathetic? And there's no way out, there's simplysNEWLINEs
no way out. It's the only model we were given - to be happy. WesNEWLINEs
weren't given any other model.sNEWLINEs

Our culture, our society, and, I'm sorry to say, even our religion gavesNEWLINEs
us no other model. You've been appointed a cardinal. What a greatsNEWLINEs
honor that is! Honor? Did you say honor? You used the wrong word.sNEWLINEs
Now others are going to aspire to it. You lapsed into what the gospelssNEWLINEs
call "the world" and you're going to lose your soul. The world, power,sNEWLINEs
prestige, winning, success, honor, etc., are nonexistent things. YousNEWLINEs
gain the world but you lose your soul. Your whole life has been emptysNEWLINEs
and soulless. There is nothing there. There's only one way out andsNEWLINEs
that is to get de-programmed! How do you do that? You becomesNEWLINEs
aware of the programming.sNEWLINEs

You cannot change by an effort of the will; you cannot changesNEWLINEs
through ideals; you cannot change through building up new habits.sNEWLINEs
Your behavior may change, but you don't. You only change throughsNEWLINEs
awareness and understanding. When you see a stone as a stone andsNEWLINEs
a scrap of paper as a scrap of paper, you don't think that the stone issNEWLINEs
a precious diamond anymore and you don't think that that scrap ofsNEWLINEs







paper is a check for a billion dollars. When you see that, you change.sNEWLINEs
There's no violence anymore in your attempt to change yourself.sNEWLINEs
Otherwise, what you call change is simply moving the furnituresNEWLINEs
around. Your behavior is changed, but not you.sNEWLINEs



DETACHMENTsNEWLINEs
40sNEWLINEs

The only way to change is by changing your understanding. But whatsNEWLINEs
does it mean to understand? How do we go about it? Consider howsNEWLINEs
we're enslaved by various attachments; we're striving to rearrangesNEWLINEs
the world so that we can keep these attachments, because the worldsNEWLINEs
is a constant threat to them. I fear that a friend may stop loving me;sNEWLINEs
he or she may turn to somebody else.sNEWLINEs

I have to keep making myself attractive because I have to get thissNEWLINEs
other person. Somebody brainwashed me into thinking I need his orsNEWLINEs
her love. But I really don't. I don't need anybody's love; I just needsNEWLINEs
to get in touch with reality. I need to break out of this prison of mine,sNEWLINEs
this programming, this conditioning, these false beliefs, thesesNEWLINEs
fantasies; I need to break out into reality. Reality is lovely; it is ansNEWLINEs
absolute delight.sNEWLINEs

Eternal life is now. We're surrounded by it, like the fish in the ocean,sNEWLINEs
but we have no notion about it at all. We're too distracted with thissNEWLINEs
attachment. Temporarily, the world rearranges itself to suit oursNEWLINEs
attachment, so we say, "Yeah, great! My team won"! But hang on;sNEWLINEs
it'll change; you'll be depressed tomorrow. Why do we keep doingsNEWLINEs
this?sNEWLINEs

Do this little exercise for a few minutes. Think of something orsNEWLINEs
someone you are attached to; in other words, something or someonesNEWLINEs
without which or without whom you think you are not going to besNEWLINEs
happy. It could be your job, your career, your profession, your friend,sNEWLINEs
your money, whatever. And say to this object or person, "I really dosNEWLINEs
not need you to be happy. I 'm only deluding myself in the belief thatsNEWLINEs
without you I will not be happy. But I really don't need you for mysNEWLINEs
happiness; I can be happy without you. You are not my happiness,sNEWLINEs
you are not my joy". If your attachment is a person, he or she is notsNEWLINEs
going to be very happy to hear you say this, but go ahead anyway.sNEWLINEs
You can say it in the secrecy of your heart. I n any case, you'll besNEWLINEs





making contact with the truth; you'll be smashing through a fantasy.sNEWLINEs
Happiness is a state of non-illusion, of dropping the illusion.sNEWLINEs

Or you could try another exercise. Think of a time when you weresNEWLINEs
heartbroken and thought you would never be happy again (yoursNEWLINEs
husband died, your wife died, your best friend deserted you, you lostsNEWLINEs
your money). What happened? Time went on, and if you managed tosNEWLINEs
pick up another attachment or managed to find somebody else yousNEWLINEs
were attracted to or something else you were attracted to, whatsNEWLINEs
happened to the old attachment?sNEWLINEs

You didn't really need it to be happy, did you? That should havesNEWLINEs
taught you, but we never learn. We're programmed; we'resNEWLINEs
conditioned. How liberating it is not to depend emotionally onsNEWLINEs
anything. If you could get one second's experience of that, you'd besNEWLINEs
breaking through your prison and getting a glimpse of the sky.sNEWLINEs
Someday, maybe, you will even fly.sNEWLINEs

I was afraid to say this, but I talked to God, and I told Him that IsNEWLINEs
don't need Him. My initial reaction was "This is so contrary tosNEWLINEs
everything that I've been brought up with". Now, some people wantsNEWLINEs
to make an exception of their attachment to God. They say, "If God issNEWLINEs
the God that I think He ought to be. He's not going to like it when IsNEWLINEs
give up my attachment to Him"! All right, if you think that unless yousNEWLINEs
get God you're not going to be happy, then this "God" you're thinkingsNEWLINEs
of has nothing to do with the real God. You're thinking of a dreamsNEWLINEs
state; you're thinking of your concept. Sometimes you have to get ridsNEWLINEs
of "God" in order to find God. Lots of mystics tell us that.sNEWLINEs

We've been so blinded by everything that we have not discovered thesNEWLINEs
basic truth that attachments hurt rather than help relationships. IsNEWLINEs
remember how frightened I was to say to an intimate friend of mine,sNEWLINEs
"I really don't need you. I can be perfectly happy without you. And bysNEWLINEs
telling you this I find I can enjoy your company thoroughly - no moresNEWLINEs
anxieties, no more jealousies, no more possessiveness, no moresNEWLINEs
clinging. It is a delight to be with you when I am enjoying you on asNEWLINEs
non-clinging basis.sNEWLINEs

You're free; so am I ". But to many of you I 'm sure this is like talkingsNEWLINEs
a foreign language. It took me many, many months to fullysNEWLINEs
understand this, and mind you, I'm a Jesuit, whose spiritual exercisessNEWLINEs
are all about exactly this, although I missed the point because mysNEWLINEs
culture and my society in general had taught me to view people insNEWLINEs
terms of my attachments. I'm quite amused, sometimes, to see evensNEWLINEs





seemingly objective people like therapists and spiritual directors saysNEWLINEs
of someone, "He's a great guy, great guy, I really like him". I find outsNEWLINEs
later that it's because he likes me that I like him.sNEWLINEs

I look into myself, and I find the same thing coming up now andsNEWLINEs
again. If you're attached to appreciation and praise, you're going tosNEWLINEs
view people in terms of their threat to your attachment or theirsNEWLINEs
fostering of your attachment. If you're a politician and you want to besNEWLINEs
elected, how do you think you're going to look at people, how willsNEWLINEs
your interest in people be guided? You will be concerned for thesNEWLINEs
person who's going to get you the vote. If what you're interested in issNEWLINEs
sex, how do you think you're going to look at men and women?sNEWLINEs

If you're attached to power, that colors your view of human beings.sNEWLINEs
An attachment destroys your capacity to love. What is love? Love issNEWLINEs
sensitivity, love is consciousness. To give you an example I'msNEWLINEs
listening to a symphony, but if all I hear is the sound of the drums IsNEWLINEs
don't hear the symphony. What is a loving heart? A loving heart issNEWLINEs
sensitive to the whole of life, to all persons; a loving heart doesn'tsNEWLINEs
harden itself to any person or thing.sNEWLINEs

But the moment you become attached in my sense of the word, thensNEWLINEs
you're blocking out many other things. You've got eyes only for thesNEWLINEs
object of your attachment; you've got ears only for the drums; thesNEWLINEs
heart has hardened. Moreover, it's blinded, because it no longer seessNEWLINEs
the object of its attachment objectively. Love entails clarity ofsNEWLINEs
perception, objectivity; there is nothing so clear-sighted as love.sNEWLINEs

ADDICTIVE LOVEsNEWLINEs
41sNEWLINEs

The heart in love remains soft and sensitive. But when you're hell-sNEWLINEs
bent on getting this or the other thing, you become ruthless, hard,sNEWLINEs
and insensitive. How can you love people when you need people? YousNEWLINEs
can only use them. If I need you to make me happy, I 've got to usesNEWLINEs
you, I 've got to manipulate you, I 've got to find ways and means ofsNEWLINEs
winning you. I cannot let you be free. I can only love people when IsNEWLINEs
have emptied my life of people. When I die to the need for people,sNEWLINEs
then I'm right in the desert.sNEWLINEs

I n the beginning it feels awful, it feels lonely, but if you can take it forsNEWLINEs
a while, you'll suddenly discover that it isn't lonely at all. It issNEWLINEs
solitude, it is aloneness, and the desert begins to flower. Then at lastsNEWLINEs
you'll know what love is, what God is, what reality is. But in thesNEWLINEs
beginning giving up the drug can be tough, unless you have a verysNEWLINEs
keen understanding or unless you have suffered enough. It's a greatsNEWLINEs
thing to have suffered. Only then can you get sick of it. You can makesNEWLINEs
use of suffering to end suffering.sNEWLINEs

Most people simply go on suffering. That explains the conflict IsNEWLINEs
sometimes have between the role of spiritual director and that ofsNEWLINEs
therapist. A therapist says, "Let's ease the suffering". The spiritualsNEWLINEs
director says, "Let her suffer, she'll get sick of this way of relating tosNEWLINEs
people and she'll finally decide to break out of this prison ofsNEWLINEs





emotional dependence on others". Shall I offer a palliative or removesNEWLINEs
a cancer? It's not easy to decide.sNEWLINEs

A person slams a book on the table in disgust. Let him keepsNEWLINEs
slamming it on the table. Don't pick up the book for him and tell himsNEWLINEs
it's all right. Spirituality is awareness, awareness, awareness,sNEWLINEs
awareness, awareness, awareness. When your mother got angry withsNEWLINEs
you, she didn't say there was something wrong with her, she saidsNEWLINEs
there was something wrong with you; otherwise she wouldn't havesNEWLINEs
been angry.sNEWLINEs

Well, I made the great discovery that if you are angry. Mother,sNEWLINEs
there's something wrong with you. So you'd better cope with yoursNEWLINEs
anger. Stay with it and cope with it. It's not mine. Whether there'ssNEWLINEs
something wrong with me or not, I'll examine that independently ofsNEWLINEs
your anger. I'm not going to be influenced by your anger. The funnysNEWLINEs
thing is that when I can do this without feeling any negativity towardsNEWLINEs
another, I can be quite objective about myself, too. Only a verysNEWLINEs
aware person can refuse to pick up the guilt and anger, can say,sNEWLINEs
"You're having a tantrum. Too bad. I don't feel the slightest desire tosNEWLINEs
rescue you anymore, and I refuse to feel guilty". I'm not going tosNEWLINEs
hate myself for anything I 've done. That's what guilt is.sNEWLINEs

I 'm not going to give myself a bad feeling and whip myself forsNEWLINEs
anything I have done, either right or wrong. I'm ready to analyze it,sNEWLINEs
to watch it, and say, "Well, if I did wrong, it was in unawareness".sNEWLINEs
Nobody does wrong in awareness. That's why theologians tell us verysNEWLINEs
beautifully that J esus could do no wrong. That makes very goodsNEWLINEs
sense to me, because the enlightened person can do no wrong. ThesNEWLINEs
enlightened person is free. J esus was free and because he was free,sNEWLINEs
he couldn't do any wrong. But since you can do wrong, you're notsNEWLINEs
free.sNEWLINEs



MORE WORDSsNEWLINEs
42sNEWLINEs

Mark Twain put it very nicely when he said, "It was so cold that if thesNEWLINEs
thermometer had been an inch longer, we would have frozen tosNEWLINEs
death". We do freeze to death on words. It's not the cold outside thatsNEWLINEs
matters, but the thermometer. It's not reality that matters, but whatsNEWLINEs







you're saying to yourself about it. I was told a lovely story about asNEWLINEs
farmer in Finland. When they were drawing up the Russian-FinnishsNEWLINEs
border, the farmer had to decide whether he wanted to be in RussiasNEWLINEs
or Finland. After a long time he said he wanted to be in Finland, butsNEWLINEs
he didn't want to offend the Russian officials.. These came to him andsNEWLINEs
wanted to know why he wanted to be in Finland. The farmer replied,sNEWLINEs
"It has always been my desire to live in Mother Russia, but at my agesNEWLINEs
I wouldn't be able to survive another Russian winter".sNEWLINEs

Russia and Finland are only words, concepts, but not for humansNEWLINEs
beings, not for crazy human beings. We're almost never looking atsNEWLINEs
reality. A guru was once attempting to explain to a crowd how humansNEWLINEs
beings react to words, feed on words, live on words, rather than onsNEWLINEs
reality. One of the men stood up and protested; he said, "I don'tsNEWLINEs
agree that words have all that much effect on us". The guru said, "SitsNEWLINEs
down, you son of a bitch". The man went livid with rage and said,sNEWLINEs
"You call yourself an enlightened person, a guru, a master, but yousNEWLINEs
ought to be ashamed of yourself". The guru then said, "Pardon me,sNEWLINEs
sir, I was carried away. I really beg your pardon; that was a lapse;sNEWLINEs
I'm sorry". The man finally calmed down. Then the guru said, "It tooksNEWLINEs
just a few words to get a whole tempest going within you; and it tooksNEWLINEs
just a few words to calm you down, didn't it"? Words, words, words,sNEWLINEs
words, how imprisoning they are if they're not used properly.sNEWLINEs



HIDDEN AGENDASsNEWLINEs
43sNEWLINEs

There is a difference between knowledge and awareness, betweensNEWLINEs
information and awareness. I just said to you that one cannot do evilsNEWLINEs
in awareness. But one can do evil in knowledge or information, whensNEWLINEs
you know something is bad. "Father, forgive them, for they know notsNEWLINEs
what they do". I would translate that as "They're not aware of whatsNEWLINEs
they are doing". Paul says he is the greatest of sinners because hesNEWLINEs
persecuted the Church of Christ. But, he adds, I did it insNEWLINEs
unawareness.sNEWLINEs

Or if they had been aware that they were crucifying the Lord of Glory,sNEWLINEs
they would never have done so. Or "The time will come when theysNEWLINEs
will persecute you and they think they are doing a service to God".sNEWLINEs
They aren't aware. They're caught up in information and knowledge.sNEWLINEs







Thomas Aquinas puts it nicely winen he says, "Every time someonesNEWLINEs
sins, they're sinning under the guise of good". They're blindingsNEWLINEs
themselves; they're seeing something as good even though theysNEWLINEs
know it is bad; they're rationalizing because they're seekingsNEWLINEs
something under the pretext of good.sNEWLINEs

Someone gave me two situations in which she found it difficult to besNEWLINEs
aware. She was in a service industry where many people were linedsNEWLINEs
up, many phones were ringing, and she was alone and there weresNEWLINEs
distractions coming from a lot of uptight, angry people. She found itsNEWLINEs
extremely difficult to maintain serenity and calm. The other situationsNEWLINEs
was when she was driving in traffic, with horns blowing and peoplesNEWLINEs
shouting four-letter words. She asked me whether eventually thatsNEWLINEs
nervousness would dissipate and she could remain at peace.sNEWLINEs

Did you pick up the attachment there? Peace. Her attachment tosNEWLINEs
peace and calm. She was saying, "Unless I'm peaceful, I won't besNEWLINEs
happy". Did it ever occur to you that you could be happy in tensions?sNEWLINEs
Before enlightenment, I used to be depressed, after enlightenment, IsNEWLINEs
continue to be depressed. You don't make a goal out of relaxationsNEWLINEs
and sensitivity. Have you ever heard of people who get tense tryingsNEWLINEs
to relax? If one is tense, one simply observes one's tension. You willsNEWLINEs
never understand yourself if you seek to change yourself.sNEWLINEs

The harder you try to change yourself, the worse it gets. You aresNEWLINEs
called upon to be aware. Get the feel of that jangling telephone; getsNEWLINEs
the feel of jarred nerves; get the sensation of the steering wheel insNEWLINEs
the car. I n other words, come to reality, and let tension or thesNEWLINEs
calmness take care of itself. As a matter of fact, you will have to letsNEWLINEs
them take care of themselves because you'll be too preoccupied withsNEWLINEs
getting in touch with reality. Step by step, let whatever happenssNEWLINEs
happen. Real change will come when it is brought about, not by yoursNEWLINEs
ego, but by reality. Awareness releases reality to change you.sNEWLINEs

In awareness you change, but you've got to experience it. At thissNEWLINEs
point you're just taking my word for it. Perhaps also you've got a plansNEWLINEs
to become aware. Your ego, in its own cunning way, is trying to pushsNEWLINEs
you into awareness. Watch it! You'll meet with resistance; there willsNEWLINEs
be trouble. When someone is anxious about being aware all the time,sNEWLINEs
you can spot the mild anxiety. They want to be awake, to find out ifsNEWLINEs
they're really awake or not.sNEWLINEs

That's part of asceticism, not awareness. It sounds strange in asNEWLINEs
culture where we've been trained to achieve goals, to getsNEWLINEs





somewhere, but in fact there's nowhere to go because you're theresNEWLINEs
already. The Japanese have a nice way of putting it "The day yousNEWLINEs
cease to travel, you will have arrived". Your attitude should be "IsNEWLINEs
want to be aware, I want to be in touch with whatever is and letsNEWLINEs
whatever happens happen; if I'm awake, fine, and if I'm asleep, fine"sNEWLINEs
The moment you make a goal out of it and attempt to get it, you'resNEWLINEs
seeking ego glorification, ego promotion.sNEWLINEs

You want the good feeling that you've made it. When you do "makesNEWLINEs
it", you won't know. Your left hand won't know what your right handsNEWLINEs
is doing. "Lord, when did we do this? We had no awareness". CharitysNEWLINEs
is never so lovely as when one has lost consciousness that one issNEWLINEs
practicing charity. "You mean I helped you? I was enjoying myself IsNEWLINEs
was just doing my dance. It helped you, that's wonderful.sNEWLINEs
Congratulations to you. No credit to me".sNEWLINEs

When you attain, when you are aware, increasingly you will not besNEWLINEs
bothered about labels like "awake" or "asleep". One of my difficultiessNEWLINEs
here is to arouse your curiosity but not your spiritual greed. Let'ssNEWLINEs
come awake, it's going to be wonderful. After a while, it doesn'tsNEWLINEs
matter; one is aware, because one lives. The unaware life is notsNEWLINEs
worth living. And you will leave pain to take care of itself.sNEWLINEs



GIVING INsNEWLINEs
44sNEWLINEs

The harder you try to change, the worse it can get. Does this meansNEWLINEs
that a certain degree of passivity is all right? Yes, the more you resistsNEWLINEs
something, the greater power you give to it. That's the meaning, IsNEWLINEs
think, of Jesus' words: "When someone strikes you on the rightsNEWLINEs
cheek, offer him your left as well". You always empower the demonssNEWLINEs
you fight. That's very Oriental. But if you flow with the enemy, yousNEWLINEs
overcome the enemy.sNEWLINEs

How does one cope with evil? Not by fighting it but by understandingsNEWLINEs
it. In understanding, it disappears. How does one cope withsNEWLINEs
darkness? Not with one's fist. You don't chase darkness out of thesNEWLINEs
room with a broom, you turn on a light. The more you fight darkness,sNEWLINEs
the more real it becomes to you, and the more you exhaust yourself.sNEWLINEs
But when you turn on the light of awareness, it melts.sNEWLINEs







Say this scrap of paper is a billion-dollar check. Ah, I must renouncesNEWLINEs
it, the gospel says, I must give it up if I want eternal life. Are yousNEWLINEs
going to substitute one greed - a spiritual greed - for the othersNEWLINEs
greed? Before, you had a worldly ego and now you've got a spiritualsNEWLINEs
ego, but you've got an ego all the same, a refined one and one moresNEWLINEs
difficult to cope with. When you renounce something, you're tied to it.sNEWLINEs
But if instead of renouncing it, I look at it and say, "Hey, this isn't asNEWLINEs
billion-dollar check, this is a scrap of paper", there is nothing to fight,sNEWLINEs
nothing to renounce.sNEWLINEs



ASSORTED LANDMINESsNEWLINEs

I n my country, lots of men grow up with the belief that women aresNEWLINEs
cattle. "I married her," they say. "She's my possession". Are thesesNEWLINEs
men to blame? Get ready for a shock: They aren't. J ust as manysNEWLINEs
Americans are not to blame for the way they view Russians. TheirsNEWLINEs
glasses or perceptions simply have been dyed a certain color, andsNEWLINEs
there they are; that's the color through which they look at the world.sNEWLINEs
What does it take to make them real, to make them aware thatsNEWLINEs
they're looking at the world through colored glasses? There is nosNEWLINEs
salvation till they have seen their basic prejudice.sNEWLINEs

As soon as you look at the world through an ideology you aresNEWLINEs
finished. No reality fits an ideology. Life is beyond that. That is whysNEWLINEs
people are always searching for a meaning to life. But life has nosNEWLINEs
meaning; it cannot have meaning because meaning is a formula;sNEWLINEs
meaning is something that makes sense to the mind. Every time yousNEWLINEs
make sense out of reality, you bump into something that destroys thesNEWLINEs
sense you made. Meaning is only found when you go beyondsNEWLINEs
meaning. Life only makes sense when you perceive it as mystery andsNEWLINEs
it makes no sense to the conceptualizing mind.sNEWLINEs

I don't say that adoration isn't important, but I do say that doubt issNEWLINEs
infinitely more important than adoration. Everywhere people aresNEWLINEs
searching for objects to adore, but I don't find people awake enoughsNEWLINEs
in their attitudes and convictions. How happy we would be if terroristssNEWLINEs
would adore their ideology less and question more. However, wesNEWLINEs
don't like to apply that to ourselves; we think we're all right and thesNEWLINEs
terrorists are wrong. But a terrorist to you is a martyr to the othersNEWLINEs







side.sNEWLINEs

Loneliness is when you're missing people, aloneness is when you'resNEWLINEs
enjoying yourself. Remember that quip of George Bernard Shaw. HesNEWLINEs
was at one of those awful cocktail parties, where nothing gets said.sNEWLINEs
Someone asked him if he was enjoying himself. He answered, "It'ssNEWLINEs
the only thing I am enjoying here". You never enjoy others when yousNEWLINEs
are enslaved to them. Community is not formed by a set of slaves, bysNEWLINEs
people demanding that other people make them happy. Community issNEWLINEs
formed by emperors and princesses.sNEWLINEs

You're an emperor, not a beggar; you're a princess, not a beggar.sNEWLINEs
There's no begging bowl in a true community. There's no clinging, nosNEWLINEs
anxiety, no fear, no hangover, no possessiveness, no demands. FreesNEWLINEs
people form community, not slaves. This is such a simple truth, but itsNEWLINEs
has been drowned out by a whole culture, including religious culture.sNEWLINEs
Religious culture can be very manipulative if you don't watch out.sNEWLINEs

Some people see awareness as a high point, a plateau, beyondsNEWLINEs
experiencing every moment as it is. That's making a goal out ofsNEWLINEs
awareness. But with true awareness there's nowhere to go, nothingsNEWLINEs
to achieve. How do we get to this awareness? Through awareness.sNEWLINEs
When people say they really want to experience every moment,sNEWLINEs
they're really talking awareness, except for that "wanting". You don'tsNEWLINEs
want to experience awareness; you do or you don't.sNEWLINEs

A friend of mine has just gone to I reland. He told me that though he'ssNEWLINEs
an American citizen he's entitled to an Irish passport and was gettingsNEWLINEs
one because he is scared to travel abroad on an American passport.sNEWLINEs
If terrorists walk in and say, "Let me see your passport," he wants tosNEWLINEs
be able to say, "I 'm I rish". But when people sit next to him on thesNEWLINEs
plane, they don't want to see labels; they want to taste andsNEWLINEs
experience this person, as he really is. How many people spend theirsNEWLINEs
lives not eating food but eating the menu? A menu is only ansNEWLINEs
indication of something that's available. You want to eat the steak,sNEWLINEs
not the words.sNEWLINEs



THE DEATH OF MEsNEWLINEs
46sNEWLINEs

Can one be fully human without experiencing tragedy? The onlysNEWLINEs





tragedy there is in the world is ignorance; all evil comes from that.sNEWLINEs
The only tragedy there is in the world is unwakefulness andsNEWLINEs
unawareness. From them comes fear, and from fear comessNEWLINEs
everything else, but death is not a tragedy at all. Dying is wonderful;sNEWLINEs
it's only horrible to people who have never understood life. It's onlysNEWLINEs
when you're afraid of life that you fear death.sNEWLINEs

It's only dead people who fear death. But people who are alive havesNEWLINEs
no fear of death. One of your American authors put it so well. He saidsNEWLINEs
awakening is the death of your belief in injustice and tragedy. ThesNEWLINEs
end of the world for a caterpillar is a butterfly for the master. DeathsNEWLINEs
is resurrection. We're talking not about some resurrection that willsNEWLINEs
happen but about one that is happening right now. If you would diesNEWLINEs
to the past, if you would die to every minute, you would be thesNEWLINEs
person who is fully alive, because a fully alive person is one who issNEWLINEs
full of death.sNEWLINEs

We're always dying to things. We're always shedding everything insNEWLINEs
order to be fully alive and to be resurrected at every moment. ThesNEWLINEs
mystics, saints, and others make great efforts to wake people up. IfsNEWLINEs
they don't wake up, they're always going to have these other minorsNEWLINEs
ills like hunger, wars, and violence. The greatest evil is sleepingsNEWLINEs
people, ignorant people.sNEWLINEs

A J esuit once wrote a note to Father Arrupe, his superior general,sNEWLINEs
asking him about the relative value of communism, socialism, andsNEWLINEs
capitalism. Father Arrupe gave him a lovely reply. He said, "A systemsNEWLINEs
is about as good or as bad as the people who use it". People withsNEWLINEs
golden hearts would make capitalism or communism or socialismsNEWLINEs
work beautifully.sNEWLINEs

Don't ask the world to change - you change first. Then you'll get asNEWLINEs
good enough look at the world so that you'll be able to changesNEWLINEs
whatever you think ought to be changed. Take the obstruction out ofsNEWLINEs
your own eye. If you don't, you have lost the right to change anyonesNEWLINEs
or anything.sNEWLINEs

Till you are aware of yourself, you have no right to interfere withsNEWLINEs
anyone else or with the world. Now, the danger of attempting tosNEWLINEs
change others or change things when you yourself are not aware issNEWLINEs
that you may be changing things for your own convenience, yoursNEWLINEs
pride, your dogmatic convictions and beliefs, or just to relieve yoursNEWLINEs
negative feelings. I have negative feelings, so you better change insNEWLINEs
such a way that I 'II feel good.sNEWLINEs





First, cope with your negative feelings so tiiat when you move out tosNEWLINEs
change others, you're not coming from hate or negativity but fromsNEWLINEs
love. It may seem strange, too, that people can be very hard onsNEWLINEs
others and still be very loving. The surgeon can be hard on a patientsNEWLINEs
and yet loving. Love can be very hard indeed.sNEWLINEs



INSIGHT AND UNDERSTANDINGsNEWLINEs

47sNEWLINEs

But what does self-change entail? I've said it in so many words, oversNEWLINEs
and over, but now I'm going to break it down into little segments.sNEWLINEs
First, insight. Not effort, not cultivating habits, not having an ideal.sNEWLINEs
Ideals do a lot of damage. The whole time you're focusing on whatsNEWLINEs
should be instead of focusing on what is. And so you're imposingsNEWLINEs
what should be on a present reality, never having understood whatsNEWLINEs
present reality is. Let me give you an example of insight from mysNEWLINEs
own experience in counseling.sNEWLINEs

A priest comes to me and says he's lazy; he wants to be moresNEWLINEs
industrious, more active, but he is lazy. I ask him what "lazy" means.sNEWLINEs
In the old days I would have said to him, "Let's see, why don't yousNEWLINEs
make a list of things you want to do every day, and then every nightsNEWLINEs
you check them off, and it will give you a good feeling; build up habitsNEWLINEs
that way". Or I might say to him, "Who is your ideal, your patronsNEWLINEs
saint"? And if he says St. Francis Xavier, I would tell him, "See howsNEWLINEs
much Xavier worked. You must meditate on him and that will get yousNEWLINEs
moving". That's one way of going about it, but, I 'm sorry to say, it'ssNEWLINEs
superficial.sNEWLINEs

Making him use his willpower, effort, doesn't last very long. HissNEWLINEs
behavior may change, but he does not. So I now move in the othersNEWLINEs
direction. I say to him, "Lazy, what's that? There are a million typessNEWLINEs
of laziness. Let's hear what your type of laziness is. Describe whatsNEWLINEs
you mean by lazy"? He says, "Well, I never get anything done. I don'tsNEWLINEs
feel like doing anything". I ask, "You mean right from the momentsNEWLINEs
you get up in the morning"? "Yes", he answers. "I wake up in thesNEWLINEs
morning and there's nothing worth getting up for". "You're depressed,sNEWLINEs
then"? I ask. "You could call it that", he says. "I have sort ofsNEWLINEs
withdrawn". "Have you always been like this"? I ask. "Well, notsNEWLINEs
always. When I was younger, I was more active. When I was in thesNEWLINEs





seminary, I was full of life". "So when did this begin"? "Oh, aboutsNEWLINEs
three or four years ago". I ask him if anything happened then.sNEWLINEs

He thinks a while. I say, "If you have to think so much, nothing verysNEWLINEs
special could have happened four years ago. How about the yearsNEWLINEs
before that"? He says, "Well, I was ordained that year". "AnythingsNEWLINEs
happen in your ordination year"? I ask. "There was one little thing,sNEWLINEs
the final examination in theology; I failed it. It was a bit of asNEWLINEs
disappointment, but I've gotten over it. The bishop was planning tosNEWLINEs
send me to Rome, to eventually teach in the seminary.sNEWLINEs

I rather liked the idea, but since I failed the examination, he changedsNEWLINEs
his mind and sent me to this parish. Actually, there was somesNEWLINEs
injustice because. . . Now he's getting worked up; there's anger theresNEWLINEs
that he hasn't gotten over. He's got to work through thatsNEWLINEs
disappointment. It's useless to preach him a sermon. It's useless tosNEWLINEs
give him an idea. We've got to get him to face his anger andsNEWLINEs
disappointment and to get some insight into all of that. When he'ssNEWLINEs
able to work through that, he's back into life again. If I gave him ansNEWLINEs
exhortation and told him how hard his married brothers and sisterssNEWLINEs
work, that would merely make him feel guilty. He doesn't have thesNEWLINEs
self-insight which is going to heal him. So that's the first thing.sNEWLINEs

There's another great task, understanding. Did you really think thissNEWLINEs
was going to make you happy? You just assumed it was going tosNEWLINEs
make you happy. Why did you want to teach in the seminary?sNEWLINEs
Because you wanted to be happy. You thought that being a professor,sNEWLINEs
having a certain status and prestige, would make you happy. WouldsNEWLINEs
it? Understanding is called for there. In making the distinctionsNEWLINEs
between "I" and "me", it's a great help to disidentify what is goingsNEWLINEs
on. Let me give you an example of this kind of thing. A young J esuitsNEWLINEs
priest comes to see me; he's a lovely, extraordinary, gifted, talented,sNEWLINEs
charming, lovable man - everything. But he had a strange kind of asNEWLINEs
kink. With employees he was a terror. He was even known to assaultsNEWLINEs
them. It nearly became a matter for the police.sNEWLINEs

Whenever he was put in charge of the grounds, the school, orsNEWLINEs
whatever, this problem would keep coming up. He made a thirty-daysNEWLINEs
retreat in what we Jesuits call a Tertianship, where he meditated daysNEWLINEs
after day on the patience and love of J esus for those who weresNEWLINEs
underprivileged, etc. But I knew it wasn't going to have an effect.sNEWLINEs
Anyway, he went home and was better for about three or foursNEWLINEs
months. (Somebody said about most retreats that we begin them insNEWLINEs
the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and wesNEWLINEs





end as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, worldsNEWLINEs
without end. Amen.)sNEWLINEs

After that, he was right back to square one. So he came to see me. IsNEWLINEs
was very busy at the time. Though he had come from another city insNEWLINEs
India, I couldn't see him. So I said, "I'm going for my evening walk; ifsNEWLINEs
you want to come with me on the walk, that's fine, but I don't havesNEWLINEs
any other time". So we went for a walk. I 'd known him before, and assNEWLINEs
we were walking, I had a strange feeling. When I get one of thesesNEWLINEs
strange feelings, I generally check it out with the person in question.sNEWLINEs
So I said, "I have a strange feeling that you're hiding something fromsNEWLINEs
me. Are you"? He became indignant. He said, "What do you mean,sNEWLINEs
hiding?sNEWLINEs

Do you think I 'd undertake this long journey and come to ask for yoursNEWLINEs
time in order to hide something"? I said, "Well, it's a funny feeling IsNEWLINEs
had, that's all; I thought I should check with you". We walked on. WesNEWLINEs
have a lake not far from where I live. I remember the scenesNEWLINEs
distinctly. He said, "Could we sit down somewhere"? I said, "O.K". WesNEWLINEs
sat on a low wall that skirts the lake. He said, "You're right. I amsNEWLINEs
hiding something from you". And with that he burst into tears.sNEWLINEs

He said, "I 'm going to tell you something I 've never said to anybodysNEWLINEs
since I became a J esuit. My father died when I was very young, andsNEWLINEs
my mother became a servant. Her job was to clean lavatories andsNEWLINEs
toilets and bathrooms, and sometimes she'd work for sixteen hours asNEWLINEs
day to get the wherewithal to support us. I 'm so ashamed of that thatsNEWLINEs
I've hidden it from everybody and I continue taking revenge,sNEWLINEs
irrationally, on her and the whole servant class". The feeling gotsNEWLINEs
transferred. No one could make sense of why this charming man wassNEWLINEs
doing this, but the moment he saw that, there was never any troublesNEWLINEs
again, never. He was all right.sNEWLINEs



NOT PUSHING ITsNEWLINEs
48sNEWLINEs

Meditating on and imitating externally the behavior of Jesus is nosNEWLINEs
help. It's not a question of imitating Christ, it's a question ofsNEWLINEs
becoming what Jesus was. It's a question of becoming Christ,sNEWLINEs
becoming aware, understanding what's going on within you. All thesNEWLINEs
other methods we use for self change could be compared to pushingsNEWLINEs





a car. Let's suppose you have to travel to a distant city. The carsNEWLINEs
breal&lt;s down along the way. Well, too bad; the car's broken down. SosNEWLINEs
we roll up our sleeves and begin to push the car. And we push andsNEWLINEs
push and push and push, till we get to the distant city. "Well", wesNEWLINEs
say, "we made it". And then we push the car all the way to anothersNEWLINEs
city!sNEWLINEs

You say, "We got there, didn't we"? But do you call this life? YousNEWLINEs
know what you need? You need an expert, you need a mechanic tosNEWLINEs
lift the hood and change the spark plug. Turn the ignition key and thesNEWLINEs
car moves. You need the expert -- you need understanding, insight,sNEWLINEs
awareness you don't need pushing. You don't need effort. That's whysNEWLINEs
people are so tired, so weary. You and I were trained to besNEWLINEs
dissatisfied with ourselves. That's where the evil comes fromsNEWLINEs
psychologically. We're always dissatisfied, we're always discontented,sNEWLINEs
we're always pushing. Go on, put out more effort, more and moresNEWLINEs
effort. But there's always that conflict inside; there's very littlesNEWLINEs
understanding.sNEWLINEs



GETTING REALsNEWLINEs
49sNEWLINEs

One red-letter day in my life occurred in India. It was a great day,sNEWLINEs
really, the day after I was ordained. I sat in a confessional. We had asNEWLINEs
very saintly J esuit priest in our parish, a Spaniard, whom I hadsNEWLINEs
known even before I went to the Jesuit novitiate. The day before IsNEWLINEs
left for the novitiate, I thought I'd better make a clean breast ofsNEWLINEs
everything so that when I got to the novitiate I 'd be nice and cleansNEWLINEs
and wouldn't have to tell the novice master anything.sNEWLINEs

This old Spanish priest would have crowds of people lined up at hissNEWLINEs
confessional; he had a violet-colored handkerchief which he coveredsNEWLINEs
his eyes with, and he'd mumble something and give you a penancesNEWLINEs
and send you away. He'd only met me a couple of times, but he'd callsNEWLINEs
me Antonie. So I stood in line, and when my turn came, I triedsNEWLINEs
changing my voice as I made my confession. He listened to mesNEWLINEs
patiently, gave me my penance, absolved me, and then said,sNEWLINEs
"Antonie, when are you going to the novitiate"?sNEWLINEs

Well, anyway, I went to this parish the day after my ordination. AndsNEWLINEs







the old priest says to me, "Do you want to hear confessions"? I said,sNEWLINEs
"All right". He said, "Go and sit in my confessional". I thought, "My,sNEWLINEs
I'm a holy man. I'm going to sit in his confessional". I heardsNEWLINEs
confessions for three hours. It was Palm Sunday and we had thesNEWLINEs
Easter crowd coming in. I came out depressed, not from what I hadsNEWLINEs
heard, because I had been led to expect that, and, having somesNEWLINEs
inkling of what was going on in my own heart, I was shocked bysNEWLINEs
nothing. You know what depressed me?sNEWLINEs

The realization that I was giving them these little pious platitudessNEWLINEs
"Now pray to the Blessed Mother, she loves you", and "RemembersNEWLINEs
that God is on your side". Were these pious platitudes any cure forsNEWLINEs
cancer? And this is a cancer I'm dealing with, the lack of awarenesssNEWLINEs
and reality. So I swore a mighty oath to myself that day "I'll learn, I'llsNEWLINEs
learn, so it will not be said of me when it is all over, 'Father, what yousNEWLINEs
said to me was absolutely true but totally useless.'"sNEWLINEs

Awareness, insight. When you become an expert (and you'll soonsNEWLINEs
become an expert) you don't need to take a course in psychology. AssNEWLINEs
you begin to observe yourself, to watch yourself, to pick up thosesNEWLINEs
negative feelings, you'll find your own way of explaining it. And you'llsNEWLINEs
notice the change. But then you'll have to deal with the big villain,sNEWLINEs
and that villain is self-condemnation, self-hatred, self-dissatisfaction.sNEWLINEs



ASSORTED IMAGESsNEWLINEs
50sNEWLINEs

Let's talk more about effortlessness in change. I thought of a nicesNEWLINEs
image for that, a sailboat. When a sailboat has a mighty wind in itssNEWLINEs
sail, it glides along so effortlessly that the boatman has nothing to dosNEWLINEs
but steer. He makes no effort; he doesn't push the boat. That's ansNEWLINEs
image of what happens when change comes about throughsNEWLINEs
awareness, through understanding.sNEWLINEs

I was going through some of my notes and I found some quotationssNEWLINEs
that go well with what I've been saying. Listen to this one: "There issNEWLINEs
nothing so cruel as nature. In the whole universe there is no escapesNEWLINEs
from it, and yet it is not nature that does the injury, but the person'ssNEWLINEs
own heart." Does that make sense? It isn't nature that does thesNEWLINEs
injury, but the person's own heart. There's the story of Paddy, whosNEWLINEs
fell off the scaffolding and got a good bump. They asked, "Did the fallsNEWLINEs





hurt you, Paddy?" And he said, "No, it was tiie stop tiiat iiurt, not thesNEWLINEs
fall." When you cut water, the water doesn't get hurt; when you cutsNEWLINEs
something solid, it breaks. You've got solid attitudes inside you;sNEWLINEs
you've got solid illusions inside you; that's what bumps againstsNEWLINEs
nature, that's where you get hurt, that's where the pain comes from.sNEWLINEs

Here's a lovely one: It's from an Oriental sage, though I don'tsNEWLINEs
remember which one. As with the Bible the author doesn't matter.sNEWLINEs
What is said is what matters. "If the eye is unobstructed, it results insNEWLINEs
sight; if the ear is unobstructed, the result is hearing; if the nose issNEWLINEs
unobstructed, the result is a sense of smell; if the mouth issNEWLINEs
unobstructed, the result is a sense of taste; if the mind issNEWLINEs
unobstructed, the result is wisdom."sNEWLINEs

Wisdom occurs when you drop barriers you have erected throughsNEWLINEs
your concepts and conditioning. Wisdom is not something acquired;sNEWLINEs
wisdom is not experience; wisdom is not applying yesterday'ssNEWLINEs
illusions to today's problems. As somebody said to me while I wassNEWLINEs
studying for my degree in psychology in Chicago years ago,sNEWLINEs
"Frequently, in the life of a priest, fifty years' experience is one year'ssNEWLINEs
experience repeated fifty times." You get the same solutions to fallsNEWLINEs
back on: This is the way to deal with the alcoholic; this is the way tosNEWLINEs
deal with priests; this is the way to deal with sisters; this is the waysNEWLINEs
to deal with a divorcee.sNEWLINEs

But that isn't wisdom. Wisdom is to be sensitive to this situation, tosNEWLINEs
this person, uninfluenced by any carryover from the past, withoutsNEWLINEs
residue from the experience of the past. This is quite unlike whatsNEWLINEs
most people are accustomed to thinking. I would add anothersNEWLINEs
sentence to the ones I 've read: "If the heart is unobstructed, thesNEWLINEs
result is love." I've been talking a great deal about love these dayssNEWLINEs
even though I told you there's nothing that can be said, really, aboutsNEWLINEs
love. We can only speak of non-love. We can only speak ofsNEWLINEs
addictions. But of love itself nothing may be said explicitly.sNEWLINEs

SAYING NOTHING ABOUT LOVEsNEWLINEs

51sNEWLINEs

How would I describe love? I decided to give you one of thesNEWLINEs
meditations I 'm writing in a new book of mine. I 'II read it to yousNEWLINEs
slowly; you meditate on it as we go along, because I've got it putsNEWLINEs
down in short form here so I can get it done in three or four minutes;sNEWLINEs
otherwise it would take me half an hour. It's a comment on a gospelsNEWLINEs
sentence. I had been thinking of another reflection, from Plato: "OnesNEWLINEs
cannot make a slave of a free person, for a free person is free even insNEWLINEs
prison". It's like another gospel sentence: "If a person makes you gosNEWLINEs
one mile, go two".sNEWLINEs

You may think you've made a slave out of me by putting a load onsNEWLINEs
my back, but you haven't. If a person is trying to change externalsNEWLINEs
reality by being out of prison in order to be free, he is a prisonersNEWLINEs
indeed. Freedom lies not in external circumstances; freedom residessNEWLINEs
in the heart. When you have attained wisdom, who can enslave you?sNEWLINEs
Anyhow, listen to the gospel sentence I had in mind earlier: "He sentsNEWLINEs
the people away, and after doing that he went up to the mountain tosNEWLINEs
pray alone. It grew late and he was there all by himself". That s whatsNEWLINEs
love is all about. Has it ever occurred to you that you can only lovesNEWLINEs
when you are alone? What does it mean to love? It means to see asNEWLINEs
person, a situation, a thing as it really is, not as you imagine it to be.sNEWLINEs

And to give it the response it deserves. You can hardly be said to lovesNEWLINEs





what you do not even see. And what prevents us from seeing? OursNEWLINEs
conditioning. Our concepts, our categories, our prejudices, oursNEWLINEs
projections, the labels that we have drawn from our cultures and oursNEWLINEs
past experiences. Seeing is the most arduous thing that a human cansNEWLINEs
undertake, for it calls for a disciplined, alert mind. But most peoplesNEWLINEs
would much rather lapse into mental laziness than take the trouble tosNEWLINEs
see each person, each thing in its present moment of freshness.sNEWLINEs



LOSING CONTROLsNEWLINEs
52sNEWLINEs

If you wish to understand control, think of a little child that is given asNEWLINEs
taste for drugs. As the drugs penetrate the body of the child, itsNEWLINEs
becomes addicted; its whole being cries out for the drug. To besNEWLINEs
without the drug is so unbearable a torment that it seems preferablesNEWLINEs
to die. Think of that image - the body has gotten addicted to thesNEWLINEs
drug. Now this is exactly what your society did to you when you weresNEWLINEs
born. You were not allowed to enjoy the solid, nutritious food of lifesNEWLINEs
namely, work, play, fun, laughter, the company of people, thesNEWLINEs
pleasures of the senses and the mind. You were given a taste for thesNEWLINEs
drug called approval, appreciation, attention.sNEWLINEs

I'm going to quote a great man here, a man named A. S. Neill. He issNEWLINEs
the author of Summerhill. Neill says that the sign of a sick child issNEWLINEs
that he is always hovering around his parents; he is interested insNEWLINEs
persons. The healthy child has no interest in persons, he is interestedsNEWLINEs
in things. When a child is sure of his mother's love, he forgets hissNEWLINEs
mother; he goes out to explore the world; he is curious.sNEWLINEs

He looks for a frog to put in his mouth - that kind of thing. When asNEWLINEs
child is hovering around his mother, it's a bad sign; he's insecure.sNEWLINEs
Maybe his mother has been trying to suck love out of him, not givesNEWLINEs
him all the freedom and assurance he wants. His mother's alwayssNEWLINEs
been threatening in many subtle ways to abandon him. So we weresNEWLINEs
given a taste of various drug addictions: approval, attention, success,sNEWLINEs
making it to the top, prestige, getting your name in the paper, power,sNEWLINEs
being the boss. We were given a taste of things like being the captainsNEWLINEs
of the team, leading the band, etc. Having a taste for these drugs, wesNEWLINEs
became addicted and began to dread losing them. Recall the lack ofsNEWLINEs
control you felt, the terror at the prospect of failure or of makingsNEWLINEs





mistakes, at the prospect of criticism by others.sNEWLINEs
So you became cravenly dependent on others and you lost yoursNEWLINEs
freedom. Others now have the power to mal&lt;e you happy orsNEWLINEs
miserable. You crave your drugs, but as much as you hate thesNEWLINEs
suffering that this involves, you find yourself completely helpless.sNEWLINEs
There is never a minute when, consciously or unconsciously, you aresNEWLINEs
not aware of or attuned to the reactions of others, marching to thesNEWLINEs
beat of their drums.sNEWLINEs

A nice definition of an awakened person: a person who no longersNEWLINEs
marches to the drums of society, a person who dances to the tune ofsNEWLINEs
the music that springs up from within. When you are ignored orsNEWLINEs
disapproved of, you experience a loneliness so unbearable that yousNEWLINEs
crawl back to people and beg for the comforting drug called supportsNEWLINEs
and encouragement' reassurance.sNEWLINEs

To live with people in this state involves a never-ending tension. "HellsNEWLINEs
is other people", said Sartre. How true. When you are in this state ofsNEWLINEs
dependency, you always have to be on your best behavior, you cansNEWLINEs
never let your hair down; you've got to live up to expectations. To besNEWLINEs
with people is to live in tension. To be without them brings the agonysNEWLINEs
of loneliness, because you miss them.sNEWLINEs

You have lost your capacity to see them exactly as they are and tosNEWLINEs
respond to them accurately, because your perception of them issNEWLINEs
clouded by the need to get your drugs. You see them insofar as theysNEWLINEs
are a support for getting your drug or a threat to have your drugsNEWLINEs
removed. You're always looking at people, consciously orsNEWLINEs
unconsciously, through these eyes. Will I get what I want from them,sNEWLINEs
will I not get what I want from them? And if they can neither supportsNEWLINEs
nor threaten my drug, I'm not interested in them. That's a horriblesNEWLINEs
thing to say, but I wonder if there's anyone here of whom this cannotsNEWLINEs
be said.sNEWLINEs



LISTENING TO LIFEsNEWLINEs
53sNEWLINEs

Now you need awareness and you need nourishment. You need good,sNEWLINEs
healthy nourishment. Learn to enjoy the solid food of life. Good food,sNEWLINEs
good wine, good water. Taste them. Lose your mind and come tosNEWLINEs
your senses. That's good, healthy nourishment. The pleasures of thesNEWLINEs







senses and the pleasures of the mind. Good reading, when you enjoysNEWLINEs
a good bool&lt;.sNEWLINEs

Or a really good discussion, or thinking. It's marvelous.sNEWLINEs
Unfortunately, people have gone crazy, and they're getting more andsNEWLINEs
more addicted because they do not know how to enjoy the lovelysNEWLINEs
things of life. So they're going in for greater and greater artificialsNEWLINEs
stimulants.sNEWLINEs

In the 1970s, President Carter appealed to the American people to gosNEWLINEs
in for austerity. I thought to myself He shouldn't tell them to besNEWLINEs
austere, he should really tell them to enjoy things. Most of them havesNEWLINEs
lost their capacity for enjoyment. I really believe that most people insNEWLINEs
affluent countries have lost that capacity. They've got to have moresNEWLINEs
and more expensive gadgets; they can't enjoy the simple things ofsNEWLINEs
life.sNEWLINEs

Then I walk into places where they have all the most marveloussNEWLINEs
music, and you get these records at a discount, they're all stackedsNEWLINEs
up, but I never hear anybody listening to them -- no time, no time,sNEWLINEs
no time. They're guilty, no time to enjoy life. They're overworked, go,sNEWLINEs
go, go.sNEWLINEs

If you really enjoy life and the simple pleasures of the senses, you'dsNEWLINEs
be amazed. You'd develop that extraordinary discipline of the animal.sNEWLINEs
An animal will never overeat. Left in its natural habitat, it will neversNEWLINEs
be overweight. It will never drink or eat anything that is not good forsNEWLINEs
its health. You never find an animal smoking. It always exercises assNEWLINEs
much as it needs - watch your cat after it's had its breakfast, looksNEWLINEs
how it relaxes.sNEWLINEs

And see how it springs into action, look at the suppleness of its limbssNEWLINEs
and the aliveness of its body. We've lost that. We're lost in oursNEWLINEs
minds, in our ideas and ideals and so on, and its always go, go, go.sNEWLINEs
And we've got an inner self-conflict which animals don't have. AndsNEWLINEs
we're always condemning ourselves and making ourselves feel guilty.sNEWLINEs
You know what I'm talking about. I could have said of myself whatsNEWLINEs
one J esuit friend said to me some years ago Take that plate of sweetssNEWLINEs
away, because in front of a plate of sweets or chocolates, I lose mysNEWLINEs
freedom.sNEWLINEs

That was true of me, too; I lost my freedom in front of all kinds ofsNEWLINEs
things, but no more! I'm satisfied with very little and I enjoy itsNEWLINEs
intensely. When you have enjoyed something intensely, you needsNEWLINEs





very little. It's like people who are busy planning their vacation; theysNEWLINEs
spend months planning it, and they get to the spot, and they're allsNEWLINEs
anxious about their reservations for flying back. But they're takingsNEWLINEs
pictures all right, and later they'll show you pictures in an album, ofsNEWLINEs
places they never saw but only photographed. That's a symbol ofsNEWLINEs

I cannot warn you enough about this kind of asceticism. Slow downsNEWLINEs
and taste and smell and hear, and let your senses come alive. If yousNEWLINEs
want a royal road to mysticism, sit down quietly and listen to all thesNEWLINEs
sounds around you. You do not focus on any one sound; you try tosNEWLINEs
hear them all. Oh, you'll see the miracles that happen to you whensNEWLINEs
your senses come unclogged. That is extremely important for thesNEWLINEs
process of change.sNEWLINEs



THE END OF ANALYSISsNEWLINEs
54sNEWLINEs

I want to give you a taste of the difference between analysis andsNEWLINEs
awareness, or information on the one hand and insight on the other.sNEWLINEs
Information is not insight, analysis is not awareness, knowledge issNEWLINEs
not awareness. Suppose I walked in here with a snake crawling upsNEWLINEs
my arm, and I said to you, "Do you see the snake crawling up mysNEWLINEs
arm? I've just checked in an encyclopedia before coming to thissNEWLINEs
session and I found out that this snake is known as a Russell's viper.sNEWLINEs
If it bit me, I would die inside half a minute. Would you kindlysNEWLINEs
suggest ways and means by which I could get rid of this creature thatsNEWLINEs
is crawling up my arm"? Who talks like this? I have information, butsNEWLINEs
I've got no awareness.sNEWLINEs

Or say I 'm destroying myself with alcohol. "Kindly describe ways andsNEWLINEs
means by which I could get rid of this addiction". A person who wouldsNEWLINEs
say that has no awareness. He knows he's destroying himself, but hesNEWLINEs
is not aware of it. If he were aware of it, the addiction would dropsNEWLINEs
that minute. If I were aware of what the snake was, I wouldn't brushsNEWLINEs
it off my arm; it would get brushed off through me. That's what I 'msNEWLINEs
talking about, that's the change I'm talking about.sNEWLINEs

You don't change yourself; it's not me changing me. Change takessNEWLINEs
place through you, in you. That's about the most adequate way I cansNEWLINEs
express it. You see change take place in you, through you; in yoursNEWLINEs





awareness, it happens. You don't do it. When you're doing it, it's asNEWLINEs
bad sign; it won't last. And if it does last, God have mercy on thesNEWLINEs
people you're living with, because you're going to be very rigid.sNEWLINEs
People who are converted on the basis of self- hatred and self-sNEWLINEs
dissatisfaction are impossible to live with. Somebody said, "If yousNEWLINEs
want to be a martyr, marry a saint". But in awareness, you keep yoursNEWLINEs
softness, your subtleness, your gentleness, your openness, yoursNEWLINEs
flexibility, and you don't push, change occurs.sNEWLINEs

I remember a priest in Chicago when I was studying psychology theresNEWLINEs
telling us, "You know, I had all the information I needed; I knew thatsNEWLINEs
alcohol was killing me, and, believe me, nothing changes an alcoholicsNEWLINEs
-- not even the love of his wife or his kids. He does love them but itsNEWLINEs
doesn't change him. I discovered one thing that changed me. I wassNEWLINEs
lying in a gutter one day under a slight drizzle. I opened my eyes andsNEWLINEs
I saw that this was killing me. I saw it and I never had the desire tosNEWLINEs
touch a drop after that. As a matter of fact, I 've even drunk a bitsNEWLINEs
since then, but never enough to damage me. I couldn't do it and stillsNEWLINEs
cannot do it". That's what I'm talking about awareness. NotsNEWLINEs
information, but awareness.sNEWLINEs

A friend of mine who was given to excessive smoking said, "YousNEWLINEs
know, there are all kinds of jokes about smoking. They tell us thatsNEWLINEs
tobacco kills people, but look at the ancient Egyptians; they're allsNEWLINEs
dead and none of them smoked". Well, one day he was havingsNEWLINEs
trouble with his lungs, so he went to our cancer research institute insNEWLINEs
Bombay. The doctor said, "Father, you've got two patches on yoursNEWLINEs
lungs. It could be cancer, so you'll have to come back next month".sNEWLINEs
He never touched another cigarette after that. Before, he knew itsNEWLINEs
would kill him; now, he was aware it could kill him. That's thesNEWLINEs
difference.sNEWLINEs

The founder of my religious order, St. Ignatius, has a nice expressionsNEWLINEs
for that. He calls it tasting and feeling the truth -- not knowing it, butsNEWLINEs
tasting and feeling it, getting a feel for it. When you get a feel for itsNEWLINEs
you change. When you know it in your head, you don't.sNEWLINEs



DEAD AHEADsNEWLINEs
55sNEWLINEs







I 've often said to people that the way to really live is to die. ThesNEWLINEs
passport to living is to imagine yourself in your grave. Imagine thatsNEWLINEs
you're lying in your coffin. Any posture you like. In India we put themsNEWLINEs
in cross-legged. Sometimes they're carried that way to the burningsNEWLINEs
ground. Sometimes, though, they're lying flat. So imagine you'resNEWLINEs
lying flat and you're dead. Now look at your problems from thatsNEWLINEs
viewpoint. Changes everything, doesn't it?sNEWLINEs

What a lovely, lovely meditation. Do it every day if you have thesNEWLINEs
time. It's unbelievable, but you'll come alive. I have a meditationsNEWLINEs
about that in a book of mine, Wellsprings. You see the bodysNEWLINEs
decomposing, then bones, then dust. Every time I talk about this,sNEWLINEs
people say, "How disgusting"! But what's so disgusting about it? It'ssNEWLINEs
reality, for heaven's sake. But many of you don't want to see reality.sNEWLINEs
You don't want to think of death. People don't live, most of you, yousNEWLINEs
don't live, you're just keeping the body alive. That's not life. You'resNEWLINEs
not living until it doesn't matter a tinker's damn to you whether yousNEWLINEs
live or die.sNEWLINEs

At that point you live. When you're ready to lose your life, you live it.sNEWLINEs
But if you're protecting your life, you're dead. If you're sitting upsNEWLINEs
there in the attic and I say to you, "Come on down"! and you say,sNEWLINEs
"Oh no, I've read about people going down stairs. They slip and theysNEWLINEs
break their necks; it's too dangerous". Or I can't get you to cross thesNEWLINEs
street because you say, "You know how many people get run oversNEWLINEs
when they cross the street"? If I can't get you to cross a street, howsNEWLINEs
can I get you to cross a continent?sNEWLINEs

And if I can't get you to peep out of your little narrow beliefs andsNEWLINEs
convictions and look at another world, you're dead, you're completelysNEWLINEs
dead; life has passed you by. You're sitting in your little prison, wheresNEWLINEs
you're frightened; you're going to lose your God, your religion, yoursNEWLINEs
friends, all kinds of things. Life is for the gambler, it really is. That'ssNEWLINEs
what J esus was saying. Are you ready to risk it? Do you know whensNEWLINEs
you're ready to risk it? When you've discovered that, when you knowsNEWLINEs
that this thing that people call life is not really life. People mistakenlysNEWLINEs
think that living is keeping the body alive.sNEWLINEs

So love the thought of death, love it. Go back to it again and again.sNEWLINEs
Think of the loveliness of that corpse, of that skeleton, of those bonessNEWLINEs
crumbling till there's only a handful of dust. From there on, what asNEWLINEs
relief, what a relief. Some of you probably don't know what I 'msNEWLINEs
talking about at this point; you're too frightened to think of it. But it'ssNEWLINEs
such a relief when you can look back on life from that perspective.sNEWLINEs





Or visit a graveyard. It's an enormously purifying and beautifulsNEWLINEs
experience. You look at this name and you say, "Gee, he lived sosNEWLINEs
many years ago, two centuries ago; he must have had all thesNEWLINEs
problems that I have, must have had lots of sleepless nights. HowsNEWLINEs
crazy, we live for such a short time. An Italian poet said, "We live in asNEWLINEs
flash of light; evening comes and it is night forever". It's only a flashsNEWLINEs
and we waste it.sNEWLINEs

We waste it with our anxiety, our worries, our concerns, our burdens.sNEWLINEs
Now, as you make that meditation, you can just end up withsNEWLINEs
information; but you may end up with awareness. And in thatsNEWLINEs
moment of awareness, you are new. At least as long as it lasts. ThensNEWLINEs
you'll know the difference between information and awareness.sNEWLINEs

An astronomer friend was recently telling me some of thesNEWLINEs
fundamental things about astronomy. I did not know, until he toldsNEWLINEs
me, that when you see the sun, you're seeing it where it was eightsNEWLINEs
and a half minutes ago, not where it is now. Because it takes a ray ofsNEWLINEs
the sun eight and a half minutes to get to us. So you're not seeing itsNEWLINEs
where it is; it's now somewhere else. Stars, too, have been sendingsNEWLINEs
light to us for hundreds of thousands of years.sNEWLINEs

So when we're looking at them, they may not be where we're seeingsNEWLINEs
them; they may be somewhere else. He said that, if we imagine asNEWLINEs
galaxy, a whole universe, this earth of ours would be lost toward thesNEWLINEs
tail end of the Milky Way; not even in the center. And every one ofsNEWLINEs
the stars is a sun and some suns are so big that they could containsNEWLINEs
the sun and the earth and the distance between them. At asNEWLINEs
conservative estimate, there are one hundred million galaxies! ThesNEWLINEs
universe, as we know it, is expanding at the rate of two million milessNEWLINEs
a second.sNEWLINEs

I was fascinated listening to all of this, and when I came out of thesNEWLINEs
restaurant where we were eating, I looked up there and I had asNEWLINEs
different feel, a different perspective on life. That's awareness. SosNEWLINEs
you can pick all this up as cold fact (and that's information), orsNEWLINEs
suddenly you get another perspective on life - what are we, what'ssNEWLINEs
this universe, what's human life? When you get that feel, that's whatsNEWLINEs
I mean when I speak of awareness.sNEWLINEs







THE LAND OF LOVEsNEWLINEs
56sNEWLINEs

If we really dropped illusions for what they can give us or deprive ussNEWLINEs
of, we would be alert. The consequence of not doing this is terrifyingsNEWLINEs
and unescapable. We lose our capacity to love. If you wish to love,sNEWLINEs
you must learn to see again. And if you wish to see, you must learnsNEWLINEs
to give up your drug. It's as simple as that. Give up yoursNEWLINEs
dependency. Tear away the tentacles of society that have envelopedsNEWLINEs
and suffocated your being. You must drop them.sNEWLINEs

Externally, everything will go on as before, but though you willsNEWLINEs
continue to be in the world, you will no longer be of it. I n your heart,sNEWLINEs
you will now be free at last, if utterly alone. Your dependence on yoursNEWLINEs
drug will die. You don't have to go to the desert; you're right in thesNEWLINEs
middle of people; you're enjoying them immensely. But they nosNEWLINEs
longer have the power to make you happy or miserable. That's whatsNEWLINEs
aloneness means. In this solitude your dependence dies. The capacitysNEWLINEs
to love is born. One no longer sees others as means of satisfyingsNEWLINEs
one's addiction.sNEWLINEs

Only someone who has attempted this knows the terrors of thesNEWLINEs
process. It's like inviting yourself to die. It's like asking the poor drugsNEWLINEs
addict to give up the only happiness he has ever known. How tosNEWLINEs
replace it with the taste of bread and fruit and the clean taste of thesNEWLINEs
morning air, the sweetness of the water of the mountain stream?sNEWLINEs
While he is struggling with his withdrawal symptoms and thesNEWLINEs
emptiness he experiences within himself now that his drug is gone,sNEWLINEs
nothing can fill the emptiness except his drug. Can you imagine a lifesNEWLINEs
in which you refuse to enjoy or take pleasure in a single word ofsNEWLINEs
appreciation or to rest your head on anyone's shoulder for support?sNEWLINEs
Think of a life in which you depend on no one emotionally, so that nosNEWLINEs
one has the power to make you happy or miserable anymore.sNEWLINEs

You refuse to need any particular person or to be special to anyone orsNEWLINEs
to call anyone your own. The birds of the air have their nests and thesNEWLINEs
foxes their holes, but you will have nowhere to rest your head in yoursNEWLINEs
journey through life. If you ever get to this state, you will at lastsNEWLINEs
know what it means to see with a vision that is clear and uncloudedsNEWLINEs
by fear or desire. Every word there is measured. To see at last with asNEWLINEs
vision that is clear and unclouded by fear or desire. You will knowsNEWLINEs
what it means to love. But to come to the land of love, you must passsNEWLINEs
through the pains of death, for to love persons means to die to thesNEWLINEs





need for persons, and to be utterly alone.sNEWLINEs

How would you ever get there? By a ceaseless awareness, by thesNEWLINEs
infinite patience and compassion you would have for a drug addict.sNEWLINEs
By developing a taste for the good things in life to counter thesNEWLINEs
craving for your drug. What good things? The love of work which yousNEWLINEs
enjoy doing for the love of itself; the love of laughter and intimacysNEWLINEs
with people to whom you do not cling and on whom you do notsNEWLINEs
depend emotionally but whose company you enjoy. It will also help ifsNEWLINEs
you take on activities that you can do with your whole being,sNEWLINEs
activities that you so love to do that while you're engaged in themsNEWLINEs
success, recognition, and approval simply do not mean a thing tosNEWLINEs
you. It will help, too, if you return to nature. Send the crowds away,sNEWLINEs
go up to the mountains, and silently commune with trees and flowerssNEWLINEs
and animals and birds, with sea and clouds and sky and stars.sNEWLINEs

I've told you what a spiritual exercise it is to gaze at things, to besNEWLINEs
aware of things around you. Hopefully, the words will drop, thesNEWLINEs
concepts will drop, and you will see, you will make contact withsNEWLINEs
reality. That is the cure for loneliness. Generally, we seek to cure oursNEWLINEs
loneliness through emotional dependence on people, throughsNEWLINEs
gregariousness and noise. That is no cure. Get back to things, getsNEWLINEs
back to nature, go up in the mountains. Then you will know that yoursNEWLINEs
heart has brought you to the vast desert of solitude, there is no onesNEWLINEs
there at your side, absolutely no one.sNEWLINEs

At first this will seem unbearable. But it is only because you aresNEWLINEs
unaccustomed to aloneness. If you manage to stay there for a while,sNEWLINEs
the desert will suddenly blossom into love. Your heart will burst intosNEWLINEs
song. And it will be springtime forever; the drug will be out; you'resNEWLINEs
free. Then you will understand what freedom is, what love is, whatsNEWLINEs
happiness is, what reality is, what truth is, what God is. You will see,sNEWLINEs
you will know beyond concepts and conditioning, addictions andsNEWLINEs
attachments. Does that make sense?sNEWLINEs

Let me end this with a lovely story. There was a man who inventedsNEWLINEs
the art of making fire. He took his tools and went to a tribe in thesNEWLINEs
north, where it was very cold, bitterly cold. He taught the peoplesNEWLINEs
there to make fire. The people were very interested. He showed themsNEWLINEs
the uses to which they could put fire - they could cook, could keepsNEWLINEs
themselves warm, etc. They were so grateful that they had learnedsNEWLINEs
the art of making fire. But before they could express their gratitudesNEWLINEs
to the man, he disappeared. He wasn't concerned with getting theirsNEWLINEs
recognition or gratitude; he was concerned about their well being. HesNEWLINEs





went to another tribe, where he again began to show them the valuesNEWLINEs
of his invention.sNEWLINEs

People were interested there, too, a bit too interested for the peacesNEWLINEs
of mind of their priests, who began to notice that this man wassNEWLINEs
drawing crowds and they were losing their popularity. So theysNEWLINEs
decided to do away with him. They poisoned him, crucified him, put itsNEWLINEs
any way you like. But they were afraid now that the people mightsNEWLINEs
turn against them, so they were very wise, even wily. Do you knowsNEWLINEs
what they did? They had a portrait of the man made and mounted itsNEWLINEs
on the main altar of the temple. The instruments for making fire weresNEWLINEs
placed in front of the portrait, and the people were taught to reveresNEWLINEs
the portrait and to pay reverence to the instruments of fire, whichsNEWLINEs
they dutifully did for centuries. The veneration and the worship wentsNEWLINEs
on, but there was no fire.sNEWLINEs

Where's the fire? Where's the love? Where's the drug uprooted fromsNEWLINEs
your system? Where's the freedom? This is what spirituality is allsNEWLINEs
about. Tragically, we tend to lose sight of this, don't we? This is whatsNEWLINEs
Jesus Christ is all about. But we overemphasized the "Lord, Lord",sNEWLINEs
didn't we? Where's the fire? And if worship isn't leading to the fire, ifsNEWLINEs
adoration isn't leading to love, if the liturgy isn't leading to a clearersNEWLINEs
perception of reality, if God isn't leading to life, of what use is religionsNEWLINEs
except to create more division, more fanaticism, more antagonism? ItsNEWLINEs
is not from lack of religion in the ordinary sense of the word that thesNEWLINEs
world is suffering, it is from lack of love, lack of awareness.sNEWLINEs

And love is generated through awareness and through no other way,sNEWLINEs
no other way. Understand the obstructions you are putting in the waysNEWLINEs
of love, freedom, and happiness and they will drop. Turn on the lightsNEWLINEs
of awareness and the darkness will disappear. Happiness is notsNEWLINEs
something you acquire; love is not something you produce; love issNEWLINEs
not something that you have; love is something that has you. You dosNEWLINEs
not have the wind, the stars, and the rain. You don't possess thesesNEWLINEs
things; you surrender to them. And surrender occurs when you aresNEWLINEs
aware of your illusions, when you are aware of your addictions, whensNEWLINEs
you are aware of your desires and fears. As I told you earlier, first,sNEWLINEs
psychological insight is a great help, not analysis, however; analysissNEWLINEs
is paralysis. Insight is not necessarily analysis.sNEWLINEs

One of your great American therapists put it very well "It's the 'Aha'sNEWLINEs
experience that counts". Merely analyzing gives no help; it just givessNEWLINEs
information. But if you could produce the "Aha" experience, that'ssNEWLINEs
insight. That is change. Second, the understanding of your addictionsNEWLINEs





is important. You need time. Alas, so much time that is given tosNEWLINEs
worship and singing praise and singing songs could so fruitfully besNEWLINEs
employed in self understanding. Community is not produced by jointsNEWLINEs
liturgical celebrations. You know deep down in your heart, and so dosNEWLINEs
I, that such celebrations only serve to paper over differences.sNEWLINEs
Community is created by understanding the blocks that we put in thesNEWLINEs
way of community, by understanding the conflicts that arise from oursNEWLINEs
fears and our desires.sNEWLINEs

At that point community arises. We must always beware of makingsNEWLINEs
worship just another distraction from the important business of living.sNEWLINEs
And living doesn't mean working in government, or being a bigsNEWLINEs
businessman, or performing great acts of charity. That isn't living.sNEWLINEs
Living is to have dropped all the impediments and to live in thesNEWLINEs
present moment with freshness. "The birds of the air . . . they neithersNEWLINEs
toil nor spin" -- that is living. I began by saying that people aresNEWLINEs
asleep, dead. Dead people running governments, dead peoplesNEWLINEs
running big business, dead people educating others; come alive!sNEWLINEs
Worship must help this, or else it's useless. And increasingly - yousNEWLINEs
know this and so do I - we're losing the youth everywhere.sNEWLINEs

They hate us; they're not interested in having more fears and moresNEWLINEs
guilts laid on them. They're not interested in more sermons andsNEWLINEs
exhortations. But they are interested in learning about love. How cansNEWLINEs
I be happy? How can I live? How can I taste these marvelous thingssNEWLINEs
that the mystics speak of? So that's the second thing -sNEWLINEs
understanding. Third, don't identify. Somebody asked me as I wassNEWLINEs
coming here today, "Do you ever feel low"? Boy, do I feel low everysNEWLINEs
now and then. I get my attacks. But they don't last, they really don't.sNEWLINEs
What do I do? First step I don't identify. Here comes a low feeling.sNEWLINEs
Instead of getting tense about it, instead of getting irritated withsNEWLINEs
myself about it, I understand I'm feeling depressed, disappointed, orsNEWLINEs
whatever. Second step I admit the feeling is in me, not in the othersNEWLINEs
person, e.g., in the person who didn't write me a letter, not in thesNEWLINEs
exterior world; it's in me.sNEWLINEs

Because as long as I think it's outside me, I feel justified in holdingsNEWLINEs
on to my feelings. I can't say everybody would feel this way; in fact,sNEWLINEs
only idiotic people would feel this way, only sleeping people. ThirdsNEWLINEs
step I don't identify with the feeling. "I " is not that feeling. "I " am notsNEWLINEs
lonely, "I" am not depressed, "I" am not disappointed.sNEWLINEs
Disappointment is there, one watches it. You'd be amazed howsNEWLINEs
quickly it glides away. Anything you're aware of keeps changing;sNEWLINEs
clouds keep moving. As you do this, you also get all kinds of insightssNEWLINEs





into why clouds were coming in tine first place.sNEWLINEs

I've got a lovely quote here, a few sentences that I would write insNEWLINEs
gold. I picked them up from A. S. Neil's book Summerhill. I must givesNEWLINEs
you the background. You probably know that Neill was in educationsNEWLINEs
for forty years. He developed a kind of maverick school. He took insNEWLINEs
boys and girls and just let them be free. You want to learn to readsNEWLINEs
and write, fine; you don't want to learn to read and write, fine. YousNEWLINEs
can do anything you want with your life, provided you don't interferesNEWLINEs
with the freedom of someone else. Don't interfere with someonesNEWLINEs
else's freedom; otherwise you're free. He says that the worst onessNEWLINEs
came to him from convent school. This was in the old days, of course.sNEWLINEs

He said it took them about six months to get over all the anger andsNEWLINEs
the resentment that they had repressed. They'd be rebelling for sixsNEWLINEs
months, fighting the system. The worst was a girl who would take asNEWLINEs
bicycle and ride into town, avoiding class, avoiding school, avoidingsNEWLINEs
everything. But once they got over their rebellion, everybody wantedsNEWLINEs
to learn; they even began protesting, "Why don't we have classsNEWLINEs
today"? But they would only take what they were interested in.sNEWLINEs
They'd be transformed. In the beginning parents were frightened tosNEWLINEs
send their children to this school; they said, "How can you educatesNEWLINEs
them if you don't discipline them? You've got to teach them, guidesNEWLINEs
them".sNEWLINEs

What was the secret of Neill's success? He'd get the worst children,sNEWLINEs
the ones everybody else had despaired of, and within six monthssNEWLINEs
they'd all be transformed. Listen to what he said - extraordinarysNEWLINEs
words, holy words. "Every child has a god in him. Our attempts tosNEWLINEs
mold the child will turn the god into a devil. Children come to mysNEWLINEs
school, little devils, hating the world, destructive, unmannerly, lying,sNEWLINEs
thieving, bad tempered. In six months they are happy, healthysNEWLINEs
children who do no evil". These are amazing words coming from asNEWLINEs
man whose school in Britain is regularly inspected by people from thesNEWLINEs
Ministry of Education, by any headmaster or headmistress or anyonesNEWLINEs
who would care to go there. Amazing. It was his charisma.sNEWLINEs

You don't do this kind of thing from a blueprint; you've got to be asNEWLINEs
special kind of person. In some of his lectures to headmasters andsNEWLINEs
headmistresses he says, "Come to Summerhill and you'll find that allsNEWLINEs
the fruit trees are laden with fruit; nobody's taking the fruits off thesNEWLINEs
trees; there's no desire to attack authority; they're well fed andsNEWLINEs
there's no resentment and anger. Come to Summerhill and you'llsNEWLINEs
never find a handicapped child with a nickname (you know how cruelsNEWLINEs





kids can be when someone stammers). You'll never find anyonesNEWLINEs
needling a stammerer, never. There's no violence in those children,sNEWLINEs
because no one is practicing violence on them, that's why". Listen tosNEWLINEs
these words of revelation, sacred words.sNEWLINEs

We have people in the world like this. No matter what scholars andsNEWLINEs
priests and theologians tell you, there are and have been people whosNEWLINEs
have no quarrels, no jealousies, no conflicts, no wars, no enmities,sNEWLINEs
none! They exist in my country, or, sad to say, they existed untilsNEWLINEs
relatively recently. I 've had J esuit friends go out to live and worksNEWLINEs
among people who, they assured me, were incapable of stealing orsNEWLINEs
lying. One Sister said to me that when she went to the northeast ofsNEWLINEs
India to work among some tribes there, the people would lock upsNEWLINEs
nothing. Nothing was ever stolen and they never told lies until thesNEWLINEs
Indian government and missionaries showed up.sNEWLINEs

Every child has a god in him; our attempts to mold the child will turnsNEWLINEs
the god into a devil.sNEWLINEs

There's a lovely Italian film directed by Federico Fellini, 8 1/2 In onesNEWLINEs
scene there's a Christian Brother going out on a picnic or excursionsNEWLINEs
with a group of eight to ten year old boys. They're on a beach,sNEWLINEs
moving right on ahead while the Brother brings up the rear with threesNEWLINEs
or four of them around him. They come across an older woman who'ssNEWLINEs
a whore, and they say to her, "Hi", and she says, "Hi". And they say,sNEWLINEs
"Who are you"? And she says, "I'm a prostitute". They don't knowsNEWLINEs
what that is but they pretend to. One of the boys, who seems a bitsNEWLINEs
more knowing than the others, says, "A prostitute is a woman whosNEWLINEs
does certain things if you pay her". They ask, "Would she do thosesNEWLINEs
things if we paid her"? "Why not"? the answer came.sNEWLINEs

So they take up a collection and give her the money, saying, "WouldsNEWLINEs
you do certain things now that we've given you the money"? ShesNEWLINEs
answers, "Sure, kids, what do you want me to do"? The only thingsNEWLINEs
that occurs to the kids is for her to take her clothes off. So she does.sNEWLINEs
Well, they look at her; they've never seen a woman naked before.sNEWLINEs
They don't know what else to do, so they say, "Would you dance"?sNEWLINEs
She says, "Sure". So they all gather round singing and clapping; thesNEWLINEs
whore is moving her behind and they're enjoying themselvessNEWLINEs
immensely. The Brother sees all this. He runs down the beach andsNEWLINEs
yells at the woman. He gets her to put her clothes on, and thesNEWLINEs
narrator says, "At that moment, the children were spoiled; until thensNEWLINEs
they were innocent, beautiful".sNEWLINEs







This is not an unusual problem. I know a rather conservativesNEWLINEs
missionary in I ndia' a J esuit. He came to a workshop of mine. As IsNEWLINEs
developed this theme over two days, he suffered. He came to me thesNEWLINEs
second night and said, "Tony, I can't explain to you how much I'msNEWLINEs
suffering listening to you". I said, "Why, Stan"? He said, "You'resNEWLINEs
reviving within me a question that I suppressed for twenty five years,sNEWLINEs
a horrible question. Again and again I asked myself: Have I notsNEWLINEs
spoiled my people by making them Christian"? This Jesuit was notsNEWLINEs
one of your liberals, he was an orthodox, devout, pious, conservativesNEWLINEs
man. But he felt he spoiled a happy, loving, simple, guileless peoplesNEWLINEs
by making them Christian.sNEWLINEs

American missionaries who went to the South Sea Islands with theirsNEWLINEs
wives were horrified to see women coming bare breasted to church.sNEWLINEs
The wives insisted that the women should be more decently dressed.sNEWLINEs
So the missionaries gave them shirts to wear. The following SundaysNEWLINEs
the women came wearing their shirts but with two big holes cut outsNEWLINEs
for comfort' for ventilation. They were right; the missionaries weresNEWLINEs
wrong.sNEWLINEs

Now . . . back to Neill. He says, "And I am no genius, I am merely asNEWLINEs
man who refuses to guide the steps of children". But what, then, ofsNEWLINEs
original sin? Neill says that every child has a god in him; our attemptssNEWLINEs
to mold him will turn the god into a devil. He lets children form theirsNEWLINEs
own values, and the values are invariably good and social. Can yousNEWLINEs
believe that? When a child feels loved (which means when a childsNEWLINEs
feels you're on his side), he's O.K. The child doesn't experiencesNEWLINEs
violence anymore. No fear, so no violence. The child begins to treatsNEWLINEs
others the way he has been treated.sNEWLINEs

You've got to read that book. It's a holy book, it really is. Read it; itsNEWLINEs
revolutionized my life and my dealings with people. I began to seesNEWLINEs
miracles. I began to see the self dissatisfaction that had beensNEWLINEs
ingrained in me, the competition, the comparisons, the that'ssNEWLINEs
notgoodenough, etc. You might object that if they hadn't pushed me,sNEWLINEs
I wouldn't have become what I am. Did I need all that pushing? AndsNEWLINEs
anyway, who wants to be what I am? I want to be happy, I want tosNEWLINEs
be holy, I want to be loving, I want to be at peace, I want to be free,sNEWLINEs
I want to be human.sNEWLINEs

Do you know where wars come from? They come from projectingsNEWLINEs
outside of us the conflict that is inside. Show me an individual insNEWLINEs
whom there is no inner self conflict and I 'II show you an individual insNEWLINEs
whom there is no violence. There will be effective, even hard, actionsNEWLINEs





in him, but no hatred. When he acts, he acts as a surgeon acts; whensNEWLINEs
he acts, he acts as a loving teacher acts with mentally retardedsNEWLINEs
children. You don't blame them, you understand; but you swing intosNEWLINEs
action. On the other hand, when you swing into action with your ownsNEWLINEs
hatred and your own violence un-addressed, you've compounded thesNEWLINEs
error. You've tried to put fire out with more fire. You've tried to dealsNEWLINEs
with a flood by adding water to it. I repeat what Neill said "EverysNEWLINEs
child has a god in him.sNEWLINEs

Our attempts to mold the child will turn the god into a devil. ChildrensNEWLINEs
come to my school, little devils, hating the world, destructive,sNEWLINEs
unmannerly, lying, thieving, bad tempered. In six months they aresNEWLINEs
happy, healthy children who do no evil. And I am no genius, I amsNEWLINEs
merely a man who refuses to guide the steps of children. I let themsNEWLINEs
form their own values and the values are invariably good and social.sNEWLINEs
The religion that makes people good makes people bad, but thesNEWLINEs
religion known as freedom makes all people good, for it destroys thesNEWLINEs
inner conflict [I've added the word "inner"] that makes people devils".sNEWLINEs

Neill also says, "The first thing I do when a child comes to SummerhillsNEWLINEs
is destroy its conscience". I assume you know what he's talkingsNEWLINEs
about, because I know what he's talking about. You don't needsNEWLINEs
conscience when you have consciousness; you don't need consciencesNEWLINEs
when you have sensitivity. You're not violent, you're not fearful. YousNEWLINEs
probably think this is an unattainable ideal. Well, read that book. IsNEWLINEs
have run into individuals, here and there, who suddenly stumble uponsNEWLINEs
this truth: The root of evil is within you. As you begin to understandsNEWLINEs
this, you stop making demands on yourself, you stop havingsNEWLINEs
expectations of yourself, you stop pushing yourself and yousNEWLINEs
understand. Nourish yourself on wholesome food, good wholesomesNEWLINEs
food. I 'm not talking about actual food, I 'm talking about sunsets,sNEWLINEs
about nature, about a good movie, about a good book, aboutsNEWLINEs
enjoyable work, about good company, and hopefully you will breaksNEWLINEs
your addictions to those other feelings.sNEWLINEs

What kind of feeling comes upon you when you're in touch withsNEWLINEs
nature, or when you're absorbed in work that you love? Or whensNEWLINEs
you're really conversing with someone whose company you enjoy insNEWLINEs
openness and intimacy without clinging? What kind of feelings do yousNEWLINEs
have? Compare those feelings with the feelings you have when yousNEWLINEs
win an argument, or when you win a race, or when you becomesNEWLINEs
popular, or when everybody's applauding you. The latter feelings IsNEWLINEs
call worldly feelings; the former feelings I call soul feelings. Lots ofsNEWLINEs
people gain the world and lose their soul. Lots of people live empty,sNEWLINEs





soulless lives because they're feeding themselves on popularity,sNEWLINEs
appreciation, and praise, on "I'm O.K., you're O.K"., look at me,sNEWLINEs
attend to me, support me, value me, on being the boss, on havingsNEWLINEs
power, on winning the race. Do you feed yourself on that? If you do,sNEWLINEs
you're dead. You've lost your soul. Feed yourself on other, moresNEWLINEs
nourishing material. Then you'll see the transformation. I've givensNEWLINEs
you a whole program for life, haven't I?sNEWLINEs
